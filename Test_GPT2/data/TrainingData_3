Quote: "Squeaky doors can be a real nuisance. Fortunately, there are several very easy fixes for this common problem. Here are some tips...Try spraying a little WD-40 (TM ) oil directly into the door hinges, with the door still attached. Operate the door to check and see if that eliminated the squeak...If the door still squeaks, apply a little powdered lubricant (e.g., powdered graphite) inside the hinge (/ squeaky part)...If you don't have any powdered lubricant, you could try using some household materials that you may have handy. Try rubbing petroleum jelly or candle wax on the hinge...repeat these steps on the other hinge(s) if necessary. "If that doesn't work, check for rust or other gunk on the rails and wheels that may be causing extra squeaking at certain door positions.<SEP>how do you stop a squeaky garage door?

I will tell youTools Required:drill/driver, Phillips screw tip, level, pencil, and stepladder. And to make the job easier, use a screw holder extension in the screw gun, and a magnetic level.How to install / hang a curtain rod:(1) Tape 8 ½” x 11” pieces of paper on the wall where the curtain rod mounts will go to prevent unnecessary marks on the wall. It is usually best to put the mounts close to the ends of the Drapery rod, so that you have as much space as possible between the mounts to stack your draperies. If your drapery rod is 120” long, you might center your mounts at 119” to utilize the entire length of the drapery rod. (2) Hold one curtain rod mount up and make sure it is high enough so that the curtains will cover the top of the window. Higher than the top of the window by a few inches may look better, and block out more light. Using a pencil, mark the location of the bottom screw hole on the paper and set the curtain rod mount down while you pre-drill a hole into the wall just deep enough to make it easy to drive the screw nice and straight. (3) Holding the curtain rod mount in one hand, and the screw gun in the other, drive the bottom screw into the wall. Level the curtain rod mount, and drive in the top screw. (4) Put the finials on the curtain rod, go to the other end of the curtain rod, lay the (magnetic) level on top of the curtain rod, hold the curtain rod and the curtain rod mount together and raise them up so the curtain rod is level, and the other end is sitting in the curtain rod mount that you have previously installed. (5) Repeat step 3 (6) Remove one finial, slide the rings onto the curtain rod, drop the curtain rod into place, and slide the curtain pins with curtains attached into the ring eyelets. (7) Remove one finial, slide the rings onto the drapery rod, drop the drapery rod into place, and slide the drapery pins with draperies attached into the ring eyelets. (8) Stand back, pat yourself on the back, and admire the quality and beauty of your new curtain rods made especially for you by Paso Robles Ironworks. How to install an extra long curtain rod:If you are installing an extra long curtain rod with a center connector and center mount, mark the center of the window, and install exactly as above, one side at a time. This means, temporarily install both finials on one of the curtain rod sections, and mount that first half as if it were a separate curtain rod. Then using the same half section with finials installed, proceed to step 4 and install the third mount. Now you are ready to put the entire curtain rod together and with a helper, and proceed to step 6.<SEP>how would i hang a curtain rod?

Just like you would break in any camshaft. Follow the instructions included, as they are made by guys who get paid lots of money to figure stuff like that out.That said, Make sure you use plenty of asembly lube, and make sure the valvetrain is adjusted. Start the motor and make sure the oil Pressure comes up to speed... probably wouldnt be a bad idea to pressurize the oilsystem before start up. Once the oil pressue is up, go for a drive, and do your best to not stay at a constant speed. Accelerate and decelerate. DONT RACE THE MOTOR!!!!

Buy your sweetie a nice dinner out, then humbly ask afterwards.   OK.  Thread your needle and knot thread at the end.  Approach garment from inside with needle.  Put needle through fabric where you want the button to lie and pull the thread through to follow.  Put the button through the needle and let it fall to the waistline.  Take needle and put it downward through another hole.  Repeat this a 3 times or so, then take a pin and put it under the thread holding the button on on the outside of the garment.  Then continue to stitch the button on until you've gone through the button 12-14 times or so.  Stop stitching when the needle is in the inside of the garment.  Push needle through the garment as close to the center of the button but UNDERNEATH the button and pull thread through.  Wind the thread around the underside of the button 3 or 4 times, then push needle and thread through to inside of garment.  Take a little bit of fabric near the button stitches and push needle/thread through until you've got a little loop left.  Take the needle and put through the loop and pull thread taut.  This will "lock" the stitch.  Repeat a couple times, then cut thread.  Remove the pin from the button on the topside of the garment.  (By using the pin in this way, you put a little "give" between the button and the fabric which will make the button lie correctly.   Regarding the hole in the fabric, you can "darn" the hole first by stitching back and forth across it to make a thread base, then use the thread base to stitch your button to.<SEP>How do you sew a button back on a pair of trousers?

The supply of both fluids is separate from each other.  Check to see which supply needs topping up.

First, do not use a knife or razor.

If you used an oil base stain you can use an oil based top coat or a water base top coat. Look for "Gloss" on the can.please note: wait ATLEAST 24 hours to apply a water base top coat to an oil based stain!If you used a water based stain, ONLY use a water based top coat!!Generally, 3 coats of a top coat will do a great job in "sealing" your project. Remember to sand in between coats with 400 to 600 gritt sand paper (after the top coat has dried). VERY LIGHT sanding is needed in between coats, FOLLOW THE WOOD GRAIN as much as possible, look for a "white dust like" and then move on to a different area.

Problem is, the thing is so old that the lever has corroded off and the mechanism/plunger are permanently clogging up the drain.  The tub drains, but very slowly.  I have tried pouring down boiling water, white vinegar, and drano.  Have tried pulling on the tripwaste with pliers.

There is no known flexible chimney liner that I would recommend if you are burning wood, a chimney fire can reach 1700-2000 degrees. Only rigid ceramic or thick SS can stand up to that. However if you are venting something at a lower temp, you might use flexible SS tubing, it has rings, but take it from me, don't.

While Citrus oils, cayenne pepper and such will keep cats out of your garden, unfortunately you have to keep applying it every time it rains.  The best thing I've found is Coco Bean Mulch.  A left over product from coco bean production, it smells like chocolate. It is very light, but when you put it down, and wet it, it forms a mat that is difficult for weeds to get through (a harmless fungus grows through it and increases the mat effect).  In addition, every cat that has ever visited my gardens since I put it down hates the smell and the texture and stay away.  I had some cats that seemed to like leaving deposits in my grass, but I crushed some of the shells, and spread the dust over the grass where it settled down and was invisible, and cats no longer even come into the garden.  It seems to work for a long time; I haven't put any new mulch down for a year.

I think you are talking about what to do for the wood on the bottom of the cabinet.  First, make sure you get the plumbing repaired first.  Simply replace the drain pipes under the sink.  I recommend replacing everything.  The parts are cheap and it is a lot easier to do it all.Seconds, using a jig saw or sawz-all (can rent at a tool rental place), cut the bottom of the cabinet out, leaving a few inches around the outside edges.  Cut a piece of plywood that fits inside the cabinet.  Set the plywood on the lip that you left when you cut the old base out.  You can screw the plywood down around the edge in a few spots and corners.  In order to get the plywood into the cabinet, you might need to cut it in half.

Here's the correct answer...for starters, don't use peanut butter... and for God's sake don't use acetone; it will ruin your paint-it's a paint removing solvent. I can't believe some of the stupid answers I see.Take some normal blue Windex window cleaner and SATURATE the spot; let it set for about 5 minutes. Then using a high pressure hose (like the kind they have at self-service car washes), blast it away. After the car's dry, give it a little polish or cleaner wax just in case the poop's acidic nature has taken away any pre-existing wax you might have previously applied. Buff. And you're done.Hope this helped.<SEP>How do you get bird "paint" (paint-like poop) off your ride?

I have the same phone, and last february I walked into a Battery Plus store (to help my friend find a phone) and the guy working there said that my phone (the z520a) is notorious for having battery problems. So far it's worked fine for me, but maybe in your case the battery did fail. Maybe you can try calling a local Sony store, or Battery Plus, if you have those in your area (I'm near Toronto).<SEP>How can my SonyErricson z520a be fixed? My cell phone apparently ran out of battery juice about 5 weeks ago and tried to recharge it, and when I plugged it ti the charger nothing happened. I tried to look at it carefully all over, on the outside and inside(taking the battery cover out, the battery itself out, and the smart chip) and nothing. Then I called Cingular to see what's going on, they were not able to help, and then I went to a local Cingular store and they said none of the C stores have technicians to repair phones. So now I have cell that is partially apart (because I unscrewed all the screwes that keep together and tried to put only 2 screws back (half way). Can anybody help me with ideas, suggestions, proven methods of fixing, or at least direct me to some local places(about 10-15 miles around 98043-which is just 10 miles north from Seattle), busineses that can fix it for sure and not costing a lot of money?Thanks, Paul.<EOS>
Here's another good blog post about the frustrations of using Wolfram|Alpha. Until they work out the user interface problems, W|A will remain a curiosity. Once they do, a user should be able to fulfill the promise of being able to synthesize new ideas by juxtaposing data in new ways.  In the mean time, I only play around with it. There's very little depth I can access without a tremendous amount of gyration.  Also, the number of errors people have found in the data and calculations is discouraging.<SEP>What is Wolfram Alpha good for? [closed]<EOS>

OK, before you go throwing countless dollars away on the rain-x and hi-dollar wiper ideas, think about this, and I'm not trying talk down, but sometimes we forget the obvious.  Your wipers are rubber, and the windshield is glass...the problem is, the wipers are hardening a bit and actually 'grabbing' the windshield when they pass.  The easiest fix is to a) treat the wipers with some household glass cleaner, the ammonia will soften the rubber, or b) run 'delayed' wipers in accordance with the rainfall, eg. don't run them full blast in a light drizzle.<SEP>How can I stop the windshield wipers on my vehicle from chattering?

you can see the bulbs through the headlamp lenses. determine which on is burned out. open the hood. sometimes the wiring and bulb retainer are difficult to get to. if you can easily access them, unplug the wires from the defective bulb.  turn the back of the bulb to the left. you will feel it get to a spot and not want to turn anymore. wiggle it a little and it should come right out. assuming you already have the replacement bulb...fit it back into the hole that the old one came out of. reconnect the wires and viola...you're done. or just get someone that has done it before to do it for you. oh, and also...don't touch the glass part of the bulb, it will decrease the life of it drastically.<SEP>How do you change a head lamp on a 2002 Pontiac Grand Am?<EOS>

I started a job like this once and had half the lino up before I learned that you can just go over it with the new floor.   So, I got some floor leveling compound to "rise up" the area that I had already pulled off in order to get everything level again.If going over it with peel and stick tiles, I would recommend priming the floor in order to achieve better adhesion.If cement board is in order, because you are going with ceramic tile... you can get cement board as thin as 1/4" so that you don't raise the floor so much that your counters become noticably short.   Thinset those boards, then staple or screw them into the underlying floor.Good luck!<SEP>how do you remove old linoleum and glue from the top of a plywood sub floor?<EOS>
Make sure the heater is off, the drain valve at the bottom is closed, and either open the relief valve on top (if you have it routed to an area where you won't mess up anything on the house) or open a couple of faucets,  hot water side. The open the valve for the water entering the heater on top of the heater. If your venting through the relief valve, be sure to stay and watch it. Also watch for leaks at the hot water heater tank and drain valve as it fills. When you get a good stream of water out of the relief valve, shut it back off. Same with any faucets you opened. Then you can turn on the heater (light the pilot if gas or turn on the breaker for electric). You should have hot water in a few hours.<SEP>How do you refill a gas hot water tank that has been drained?

No easy way, but here is a way. Dig around the perimeter to a depth of about two feet by about 18" wide, pour in 8" of gravel and lay in drain pipe (4") with holes facing down. Cover pipe with about 4 more inches of grave. This makes a French Drain...complete the drain system by having the pipe feed into a sump, place a sump pump into the sump and hose it out to the street...Back fill the "trench with sand/dirt mix AFTER placing a fine mesh over the gravel/pipe installation...like fiberglass cloth to prevent the gravel/pipe from plugging over time.

How much you got in your wallet$$$  Base price is based upon how much the Oil producing Czar wants per barrel.
