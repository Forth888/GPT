Ok Tessiecom,  If the door you have is not a "pre-hung" door then you're in for a challenge.  Although a pre-hung door can be installed much easier than a "slab door", it can be done.  The first website below will show you how to install a door that is pre-hung.  and the second will give you some ideas on what is involved in prepping the slab door before hanging it.  I hope this helps, and I will add more as I find it.The last link is a Lowe's link, it's pretty detailed.  Another thought I had is that a lauan door is generally hollow, which doesn't leave much wood around the outside edge of the door.  That translates into "not much room for error"  especially where the mortising for hinges and beveling doors edge is concerned.  So one helpful hint- Measure Twice and Cut Once.  Good luck.<SEP>how do i install a lauan door?<EOS>

The best way to test an automotive battery is to load test it. To do this you must fully charge the battery first. When the battery is fully charged, take a load tester (borrow from Auto Zone) hook the cables to your battery, and crank it up to the amps that the battery is rated. If the needle remains steady, the batt is good, if it drops sharply, the battery is bad.<SEP>how can i read test results from an automotive battey test?<EOS>

inline 6's are pretty good. with a few mods, you can make that straight 6 compete with the v8's. But for your question...need to know a few things. Is your supra front wheel drive or rear wheel drive (i'm betting front)? Second, you may need to strengthen you front end to support the weight of a heavy stock V8. 3rd, if you have a front wheel drive vehicle, then you may have clearance issues with the hood and engine compartment. If it's rear wheel drive then i'd say take the tranny out of the camaro too and figure a way to get that in there. so, after all that, look on the on the internet for an adapterplate to go inbetween your japanese tranny to your american motor. also you may need to change (i think) the flywheel on your american motor, as well as other stuff on the japanese tranny. you will also have big mounting issues trying to put that v8 amercian standard (inches) into a japanese (metric) system. you'd need the motor mounts and...gosh, really, it would be much simpler to modify your straight 6. they put out some really good power.<SEP>How to convert an Inline 6 for a 91 Supra to a V8?

How to disable auto-save in Google Docs?<SEP>Yeah, you can't disable it for now but if you really want on-demand saving then you might want to try a compromise. If you have Microsoft Office, you could install Google's Cloud Connect . It is a free plugin that integrates Microsoft Office and Google Docs. With it, you can edit your document offline and then sync your edits with Google Docs.  If you're using OpenOffice then you could use OpenOffice.org2GoogleDocs . It does pretty much the same thing with the added benefit that you could connect it to Zoho Docs and your own WEBDAV servers as well.<EOS>

You are probably going to have to wait for the wood to dry out.  But to expedite the process get one of those containers by DampRid that has the granules in it to absorb moisture.  Place it in the room along with some oscillating fans.  The DampRid will absorb the moisture out of the air coming from the wood.  Don't put the granules on the wood, just leave it open near to where the spill occurred.Then, once you are certain you have thoroughly dried out the wood, try to use Howards Restore-a-finish in a color similar to your floor.  Because of the variation in parquet flooring, you may need to purchase two different colors.  Fornby's also has a kit you can use, if you cannot find Howards.   Neither one will harm your floor, but if you have warpage as a result of the volume of water, you may be looking at replacement of that area.<SEP>How do you care for wood parquet floors after water has been spilled on them?

Get a hammer and a pointed chisel (one for metal or concrete, not wood) and just enlarge the hole.  Depending on if you have 2 hole or 3 hole blocks this will be either easy or hard.

The ECU is located on the front floor, about under the passenger's toes. Pull the carpet down; a large protective cover will be seen over the ECU. On the upper edge of the cover is a window or opening, allowing the Light Emitting Diode (LED) to be viewed. Turn the ignition ON, but do not start the engine. The LED should begin to flash. NOTE: In the event that a code is encountered which is not on the chart, re-count the number of flashes. If the code is truly wrong, it will be necessary to swap the ECU for a known-good unit and recheck. Since this can be expensive, you may wish to bring the car to a reputable repair facility if no other cause of the failure can be found. This may save you the expense of purchasing an unnecessary part. Once the codes are read, refer to the appropriate troubleshooting chart for testing procedures. Note that some tests will require the Honda test harness. (Use harness No. 07HAZ-PJ7010A and 07HAZ–PH7000A for 1988–89 and 07LAJ–PT30100 for 1990). This is a device which allows safe testing of the electrical circuits without backprobing connectors. It installs between the ECU and the wiring harnesses.

I am not a mechanic, but I did change an o2 sensor on a my 92 maxima once.

Search in Gmail - How to search the mails without reply?<SEP>None of the previous answers worked for me. Searching for -subject:re and equivalents seem to match EVERY conversation. I believe this is because that search is positive for the first message in the conversation (which does not have "Re:" in the subject line).  What works for me is:   Create a label (I called it "HasReply") using the filter: subject:(+re)  Then search for -label:hasreply or -label:hasreply -from:me   The logic here is that the first search will find all of the conversations with a reply. The second will then exclude those - leaving the messages without replies.  Adding the -from:me addresses a corner case where I'm searching a bunch of emails, sent NOT from me, to multiple recipients, and I want to find the ones NOBODY has replied to. Without the -from:me the results will for some reason include conversations where I am the only person who has replied. Adding this would not be appropriate in answering the original question, where the person wanted to find emails he had sent (which this would exclude) and had not received a reply to.  Alas, it is still not perfect. I create and apply the filter ("to matching conversations") and all is good. Then new replies come in and they don't seem to be added to the label...so I have to go back in like I'm editing the filter and re-apply it to catch the latest messages.<EOS>

Before any adjusting of the carb you must correct your timing by using a timing light. Crawl under the car with the car in park and the hot wire off the ignition, and have friend bump the ignition. With a flash light you should be able to see a groove on the harmonic balancer. Take a piece of soap stone or chalk and define this groove. With this done reconnect the hot wire to the distributor. Hook the timing light up to the battery and to the no. 1 plug wire. Now you are ready to check your timing. with the car running remove the vacuum advance line to the distributor and adjust the timing by turning the distributor to bring the timing mark to 8-14 degrees BTDC (Before Top Dead Center) this should get you in the ballpark for carb adjustment.There is not that much adjustments that can be made to a Q-Jet. The only one are the air and fuel mixture screws at the front of the carb. This takes allot of trial and error before you get good at this. If you turn the screws till you have your best idle you should be fine. That's what I do. don't forget to hook your vacuum advance line back up before making carb adjustments.<SEP>how do I adjust the fuel intake on my quadrajet carburetor?

Sadly, you need to go to the dealer to get more keys. One, becuase only Honda keys can be programed to your immobilizer system.

Assuming you`re speaking residential doors, if no screws are visible on either side, most commonly you would look for a small rectangular hole in the shaft of the inside knob or lever. Using a very small straightblade screwdriver, push the tip into the hole. At the same time pull the knob or lever. next remove the finish cover. You should find a small notch in the edge that you can insert your screwdriver and twist. This should expose your screws. That is providing you have this style of device. Hope this was the one.

Visualy inspect shock absorber for oil leaks,that is a sure sign that is defective.But depending on the mileage of your vehicle,the shock could be worn out without showing an oil leak.Another quick check,press down hard on your vehicle to compress the suspension,if your vehicle bounces up and down more than once,better get new shocks.<SEP>How can I tell when my car needs new shock absorbers?

I have a huge poured concrete porch. I can't ignore it anymore because it's such a dreadful mess. I decided I'd refinish it with e-z stone. The complete line of bonder, stone coat and sealer makes it perfect for my project. Here's my problem: The walls of the porch were painted by some fool. Of course, the paint is peeling. To prepare the surface for the e-z stone, I started wire brushing the loose paint. (e-z stone products adhere to secured paint.) When wire brushing, certain areas of the wall are crumbling! After I'm done scraping away all the old paint, and clean the surface, how should I repair the concrete before I begin to resurface it?<EOS>
No easy way, but here is a way. Dig around the perimeter to a depth of about two feet by about 18" wide, pour in 8" of gravel and lay in drain pipe (4") with holes facing down. Cover pipe with about 4 more inches of grave. This makes a French Drain...complete the drain system by having the pipe feed into a sump, place a sump pump into the sump and hose it out to the street...Back fill the "trench with sand/dirt mix AFTER placing a fine mesh over the gravel/pipe installation...like fiberglass cloth to prevent the gravel/pipe from plugging over time. This will keep you very dry.<SEP>How can you drain clay soil around a house to keep it from seeping into a enclosed porch sitting at ground ?

Dry rubber sponges remove smoke well-without noxious fumes.Then a coat or three of paint will be necessary. 3000 square feet will take 4 people a week to complete. The paint will mask some of the odor. Try incense for the rest. As for the stone on the fireplace there is a product from saver systems that will take care of mild smoke residue, but it may need something more than that. If it does, you will need to vacate the residents for a day. Then you cover the area with heavy plastic sheeting, set up a fan system for fume elimination and break out the industrial strength masonry cleaner/acid available at your local hardware store. DO NOT attempt to fix your own fireplace! Do it yourselfers beware, this is not your realm. One chimney fire is enough, the second one may be YOUR last. There are liners and retrofits for this but improper installation can be more dangerous than leaving it unattended. Call a certified chimney sweep for an evaluation and let them perform the necessary repairs. I can't enjoy a fireplace if I'm worried about a slow or fast moving fire escaping from it while I sleep.<SEP>How do I clean smoke-damaged walls and a stone fireplace damaged in a house fire.

MSD makes a box for that. I'ts the MSD 6A. try increasing the spark and you can run a bit leaner. If you look at the Hemi engine you'll see its built for flow. think about having the heads port and polished. also getting the valves turned. The less work load the engine has the less heat it will in retrospect have to produce. when your fuel is delivered it may also be sent up from the frame rail around the motor. Lean away from heat conducting hoses I.E. braided lines. Let the carb atomize the fuel not the hose. Change the carb and intake manifold. For your application I would use Edelbrock gear.

Here's the best way to remember the proper order to install or remove battery cables.When installing, you need to connect the positive cable first.  Remember  " + " means "add" as in you're adding the cables.Likewise, the reverse is true when removing the cables.First remove the negative cable.Remember " - " means "subtract" as in you are removing the cables."+" first on."-" first off.This little mnemonic has stayed with me for a lifetime.Hope it serves you well<SEP>How do you install a car battery?

What sjaquay5708 the maintenance tech said is right on. You've got to find the source, first. He named the most common -- toilet fill valve and hot water pressure relief valve. There are more possibilities, too.Put on your Sherlock Holmes cap and be alert to what's happening the next time you hear the squeal. It can come from the startup or idle down of a motor. What runs regularly? Furnace, refrigerator, freezer. Pay attention to what else is happening close in time to the squeal.Smoke alarms, when the battery is dying, will put out a random sound usually described as a "chirp" but that might come out as a short squeal.Doors can squeal when opened or closed or moved by the wind.At one time, way back when, TVs had tubes. When a tube was going bad there would often be a 60-cycle squeal. Only about one in three people could hear it. This would usually happen when the TV was turned on or off. Nowadays I would doubt anything like this, but hey, who knows?Some devices have a low battery warning even when turned off, and what about a forgotten alarm? Is there a lost cell phone in the couch cushions or a clock radio buried under clothing?Be imaginative. Use your hearing, your eyes, and your sense of what is going on to help isolate the cause. Then you can have Dr. Watson write your memoirs."When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." --  Sherlock Holmes "Adventure of the Blanched Soldier"<SEP>How do I find and fix the source of a high-pitched squeal periodically sounding in my house?

You will need to remove the tile surrounding the area, clean off the backs of each tile.  Remove as much of the old leveler as possible with a scrapper.  Purchase a leveler with a latex additive, for elasticity, re-level the area and feather into the surrounding area.  Take some 50 grit sand paper and sand the leveler smooth to match the current floor height.  Apply new flooring adhesive to the area with a 1/16" notch trowel.  Reset the tile and roll tile flat using a flooring roller.  If you do not have a flooring roller, you can use a baking rolling pin, use all of you weight.<SEP>How can I fix my floor?

The drain it's self unscrews out of the bottom of the tub, and a new one re threaded back into it's place. If it is the overflow, there are 2 screws that hold it into place, they can be removed allowing you to pull the water stop assembly up and out of the hole, you do the opposite to replace it with a new one. PS when you replace the drain in the bottom of the tub there are 2 things you will need. 1. the drain removal tool, and 2. some plumbers putty, both of which can be found at your local hardware store. Take an amount of plumbers putty in your hand and roll it into a log. Wrap it around the drain, and re-insert the drain back into place, if you have used enough plumbers putty it will work out from around the drain  (all around) as you tighten it back down.Good luck.<SEP>How can you repair a bathtub drain ??? w/o (tearing out the wall)that my husband wants to do, lol  , cause On the other side of the wall is our built-in dishwasher in the kitchen next to that is our kitchen sink  ??? we dont need to make an ant hill out of a mule hill !!! so, what's an inexspensive way should we go about repairing ???<EOS>
Debra, the starter must be uninstalled manually.After the starter is in your hands set it down on a surface or table near the vehicles battery.You will need a pair of jumper cables which you will attach to the battery terminals.You must then very carefully touch the cable terminal extensions from the battery to the 'bendix' of the starter (this is the mechanism that sends the gears into the starter motor and also contacts with the 'flywheel') and the other cable to the body or external armature of the starter.The bendix should kick in and the starter should whirl around.If the bendix does not engage the problem may be in the terminal relays. If the starter is engaged by the bendix but refuses to whir, then you may have a problem with the starter shaft bushings. If the bushings are worn out this will allow the body of the rotor to make contact with the starter casing which creates an electrical feed that makes the starter shaft rotate and thusly turn over the flywheel which in turn turns over the engine. Bushings are easy to replace and if you can learn how to do this you will save a bundle.As for the alternator problem you may have a good read out on your battery charging gauge if the alternator is working. Another way to find out whether the alternator is putting out energy is to turn your cars' engine on and then disconnecting one of the battery terminals. If the engine dies out you may have a bad alternator. Another method is by using an electronic meter to measure the alternators output. And by the way, alternators also fall victim to worn bushings that can be replaced by the owner of the car.  Have a good one,  Jose<SEP>How do i test  a starter and alternator in a 1992 pontiac grand am? car turns over, but wont start<EOS>
Is there any way to see traffic sources to a Github project?<SEP>It's now a baked in feature under the GitHub Traffic section .   You can now see detailed analytics data for repositories that you're an owner of or that you can push to. Just load up the graphs page for your particular repository and you'll see a new link to the traffic page.   The old method used to be some hack like adding an image or similar web bug to your README file.  When someone comes across your repo, provided your README has an extension that GitHub will automatically render , then it should also load the image. And that should, depending on how the web bug is set up, give you some detail or clue as to the source of traffic.  Or you could appeal via contact to the GitHub Supportocats and see if they're willing to give you a heads up on the incoming source of the sauce.<EOS>

As for how to powerwash....Just use your powerwasher on the deck. The high-powered stream should remove all the old stain and dirt that has been acummulating on it. You'll notice the difference immediately once you start.The difference between staining a deck and sealing it is simple. Staining refers to changing the appearance, or color, of the wood. You can use a darker stain to have the deck look like cherry wood or go with a lighter stain to have it look like oak, or cedar. Stain isn't necessary, it just helps to improve the look of the deck.Sealing involves puting a chemical coating on the wood to protect it from the elements, specifically water and moisture. It's a very important part of the upkeep for a deck.As far as what you should do with your deck? That's for you to decide. I would think the sealing is mandatory, but the staining is optional. You'll have to decide if you like the way the deck currently looks, or if you would like to change the wood's finish.<SEP>How do you clean a deck with a powerwasher?
