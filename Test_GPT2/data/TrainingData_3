The white is a neutral wire and goes to the 4 other white wires. It may be hard to find a wirenut big enough to fit 5 wires into one wirenut. You may need to add a pigtail wire and divide the 4 white wires in the box into 2 sets of 2 wires with wirenuts (using the pigtail wire to connect the 2 sets of white wires)and install the fans white wire into one of these sets of white wires. The ground should be connected to a green wire. Older home do not have a green wire so if you connect it to some part of the electrical box, it will be grounded at the box and through the conduit to your fuse boxes ground. I usually drill and tap a hole inside the bottom of the box and use that as a ground using a machine screw. There are so many wires in that box it might be a good idea to use electrical tape to securely insulate the wirenuts from vibrating off the wires and tapeing the bare ground wire to insulate it against any future vibration issues. <SEP> how do u id the correct wires from the home to a ceiling fan the fan is esy to id but the home wire are not? the fan has blue black white and raw the home wires are black blue (1 each) 4white/beige and tucked up in the box is red i know the black and blue go to the black but where's the raw(ground) and the white go to? <EOS>
Logically if you repeatedly send emails that gmail interprets as spam then your email account will become a candidate for going on a blacklist.  So I would start out with a throwaway test email rather than one you might want to use again.  Secondly the easiest way to simulate spam is to farm the farmers.

If you must open the windows, not just want to see if they open, you can cut the paint seal along the sash or sides of the window with a knife.  Then cut the seal at the top and bottom of the window.  Insert a chisel under the bottom of the window, and as you force the chisel in, the window will break the seal, and move upwards.If you have windows that seal below the sill, take a hammer, and a piece of wood, and a cloth.  Put the cloth on top of the piece of wood.  Place the cloth/wood against the inside of the upper frame of the window that you want to raise, and tap upwards on the wood with the hammer. That should break the paint seal, and cause the window to rise.Good luck. <SEP> how do i open wooden windows that have been painted shut? <EOS>

Abrasive action of some sort. You'll have to find out what works for you.Also, I assume you don't mean big pieces of concrete, but something smaller like dripping or splash from another project. Big pieces will need to be broken apart and manually moved out. You can rent an electric or pneumatic jack hammer, or use a sledge hammer.Very high pressure power washers (rental) can cut concrete.An angle grinder with various disks can scrape it away. For the lightest splash, a wire wheel in the angle grinder should work.Use goggles, leather work gloves and all recommended safety equipment when doing this.

Check the hose, wand and cleaning tools for obstructions. Debris often collects where one part plugs into another, or where the hose connects to the main vacuum housing. Remove the parts one at a time and remove any debris you find.  Clear any hidden obstructions by pushing a broom handle through the hose and wands.  Reassemble all the parts.  You may also have to replace the drive belt.1. Unplug the machine and flip it over so you can access the agitator brush.  2. Unscrew the bottom plate that holds the brush in place, using a screwdriver.    3. Lift out the brush by pulling the roller ends out of the slots in the vacuum base. If the drive belt isn't completely broken, one end will be wrapped around the agitator brush, the other around the motor drive shaft. Slide the belt off of each part. Take it to a hardware store to get a replacement.    4. Inspect the agitator brush before installing the new belt. Sometimes thread or hair will wrap around the ends or elsewhere on the brush roller. This can prevent the agitator from turning and cause a belt to fail prematurely. Cut any thread or hair with a sharp knife and pull it off.    5. Install the new belt. Slide one end over the agitator brush and the other over the drive shaft. Then reinstall the agitator brush. You may have to pull on the agitator brush to stretch the new belt a bit so the roller ends fit into the vacuum base.    6. Reinstall the bottom plate. <SEP> How to fix a vacuum cleaner?

May I suggest two options. There is a rubbing clay that you can use that you rub in using a circular pattern. This clay is available at auto parts stores and you can use it to start your oxidation.another suggestion, you can use a prewax cleaner or a liquid oxidation remover for removing dead paint and oxidation. Another thing you can try is a rubbing compound and you just rub in on in a circular motion and then wipe it off.After you use the clay or rubbing compound, you need to cover it with a coat of wax to get the scratches back out that the rubbing compound causes.

If you're talking about a transit the things are a nightmare to set up then you have to learn how to read them.To set it up properly you have to align the tripod over the point that you're shooting from using the plumb bob and make sure it's level, then put the transit on it and level the transit out.  This alone can take a while.Then you have to know how to read what it's saying.  Digital Theadolites (sp) automatically tell you the angle you turned once you line it up and set it to zero.  So you'll have to set it to zero then turn the angle and line it up.  Once you're close you can use the fine adjustment screws to line it up on the mark.  You'll need to turn the angle a few times and average out the readings.The type I used had a marking system that i can't remember the name of but it's very difficult to explain. <SEP> how do you use a builders transit? <EOS>

The way you describe it, I assume you took two very long lengths of chain and tried to throw them over the tree limb, and ending up with 2 hanging lengths of chain on each side of your swing. This is more difficult to get to swing because as you try to swing, one side of the chain fights with the other side. What you need to do is loop the chain over the limb, then you need to attach the end of the chain to a link iin the chainup by the limb, so that a single strand of chain hangs down to your swing. This arrangement would give you 2 strands of chain total hanging from the limb, one for each side of the swing. It should work fine like this. <SEP> How do you make a swing swing from a tree? I have two chains over a limb.  On the chains there is rubber at the top to protect the tree limb.  The problem is now the swing doesn't swing because there is no give at the top.

You probably need to have a repair person check it out.

Most spring loaded hinges for entry doors are set at the factory. They are installed based on the weight of the door, desired rate of closure, etc. If your door is not closing fast enough, then one of the springs is probably broken and will require replacing the hinge. If it's closing to fast, best bet is to replace the hinges with "lighter" units. Some custom hinges and most exterior gate spring loaded hinges have a "roll pin" adjustment to increase or decrease tension. Youll need an adjustment tool, usually a drift pin, to move the roll pin assembly one way or the other to adjust tension. <SEP> How do you adjust a spring loaded hinge on a door? <EOS>

clean the drain inside of it.  take off the cover and stick your hands in there to see if anything's blocking the drain.  their might be a trap of some sort to catch all the dirt that gets washed in there.  you need to clean it out so it doesn't fill up with dirt to block the flow of water..also try and move as much water away from those stairs as possible. clean the gutters so the water's going into the gutters, and make sure the downspouts are carrying the water well away from the home. <SEP> How can you prevent water from seeping under the door into the basement?

Hi,Same thing happened to me only mine was torn up for 10 years. Here's what I did:1.  I picked out the flooring I wanted2.  I called and arranged for the flooring company to lay the floor.3.  The night before the floor was to be laid, I asked my husband to move the stove as it was gas and I wasn't sure how to move it.When he asked why, I told him I was having the floor put in the next day.4.  This spurred him to work on the subfloor and he called and told the floor company not to come.  I waited 4 more months before the subfloor was completed.  5.  Once the subfloor was completed, I called the floor company to come in and lay the tile.  Of course, I'm divorced now so not sure if you really want to try this or not.  :)  However, I do have a floor now. <SEP> How do you get your husband stimulated to complete the kitchen floor which has been torn up for two years.? <EOS>

If youre talking about a chrome panel on the lower side of the door,you would first remove it by prying from the door.Perhaps a razor knife on the edge to get it started and then use an adheisive remover (goo-gone) to satuarate the underside of the old panel as it peels away.If it isnt a chrome metal panel then it may be a chrome tape type of panel.In either case,the adheisive remover will get things rolling.Scrape the remaining glue or residue on the door and clean it real good.When you add the new chrome piece it will most likely have an adheisive backing that you peel and stick.Its a good idea to line up the new piece exactly where you want it and mark it with a pencil before removing the backing.That way there are no mistakes because once its on,its on.   Now if this trim youre speaking of is held on by screws,simply remove them,pry the old trim off,clean the area real good and install the new one in its place. <SEP> How do I replace just the chrome trim on the lower right sliding door on my 2002 Ford Windstar SE ?? <EOS>

Here are some ideas to try:Sap usually drips from freshly pruned trees in the spring. Avoid parking beneath them if you have a choice!While engaging a professional detailer or body shop is preferable, there are a few things you can do yourself.- Try a mild solvent, such as Kerosene. This is the primary ingredient in most commercially available bug and tar removers. - Dab some onto a clean cotton or terry rag, and rub the paint gently. Do not rub hard or you run the risk of scratching the paint.- Our professional uses a citrus degreaser and a piece of soft modeling clay. He applies a small amount of degreaser onto the sap, and rubs gently in circles using the modeling clay until the sap spot is gone. - Once the sap is removed from the finish it is important to wash the vehicle and re-wax to restore the glossy shine. If there are any fine scratches, try removing them using a rubbing compound before you wax. <SEP> How do you remove stubborn tree sap from my car? <EOS>

regular maintenance is the thing. Especially the oil change every 3000 miles. My toyota van has 242,000 miles on it, and my last one had 250k. Both even had head gasket leaks for over 50k miles! Oil changes, my friend, oil changes.Inline engines last longer in general than V or opposed cylinders, because they have more main bearings than cylinders. More cylinders last longer than less in general, because the wear and load is spread between more cylinders, so they wear slower.I had a 1970 Maverick with an inline 6 cylinder and a 1 bbl carb with automatic transmission. It would pretty much never die, because short of running out of one of the fluids, or forgetting to change one on time, you could never blow the motor even if you floored it everywhere you went. 1 barrel can't dump in enough gas to make it wind up harder than 7 main crank bearings could handle. That was the first car I ever got over 200,000 miles.

One word of advice, when it comes to airbag repair, if you don't know what you are doing, DON'T! If you still wish to dive further, consult a factory manual! Also, other parts need to be replaced such as the sensor that caused it to go off. If you replace the airbags and not the other parts, you risk the new bags going off. Not pretty!

If you are good friends with a technician at a local repair center (or if you are good at becoming good friends with people quickly) they may help you out for next to nothing. Some libraries (especially in collage towns) have a version of electronic service information available to the public. You can also take a trip down to your local auto parts store and purchase a Chilton or Haynes manual for around $20, these manuals are limited in the information they give you but they have descriptions of DTC’s (Diagnostic Trouble Codes). From there you can do your pin-point tests to determine the root cause of the problem that set the code. Additionally, there are vast sources on the internet for such information. A simple search could help you determine what the number means; however to properly diagnose the problem, you are going to need access to a bit more than what is available for free on the internet. All Data has a service available that allows you to access the same information shops have for a small fee. And, if you are looking for guidance in repairing the problem yourself, I myself can assist you VIA e-mail. I am in the process of setting up a small internet business unlike any other I have come across, where I walk people through problems with their vehicles for a small fee—cheaper than going to a shop or misdiagnosing and buying unneeded parts, yet enough to make it worth my while to do every night.

Look for a radiator drain spigot usually on the bottom driver's side of the radiator. Once the engine has cooled, take the radiator cap off and open the drain spigot. About 1-2 gallons drain out into your drain pan which you store in a used plastic container for toxic substance disposal at your local land fill facility. Now close the drain spigot and fill the radiator with distilled water. Put the radiator cap back on and drive the car for at least 30 minutes with the heater on full. Repeat the same procedure after the engine has cooled, driving the car again for another 30 minutes or so. The idea is to dilute the antifreeze concentration in the coolant system to the point that it's mostly distilled water. Finally, empty the radiator one last time and fill it with a 100% concentration of antifreeze. That will give you a 50/50 concentration of new antifreeze since about half of the coolant system capacity is in the radiator and half is in the engine and heater core etc. Run the engine at idle until the thermostat opens and all air is bled out the radiator cap opening. Keep topping off the radiator to keep it full. Put the radiator cap back on and the job is done. You can flush the overflow coolant tank with a garden hose. <SEP> how do I change the coolant on a 1995 Ford windstar? <EOS>
open the drivers side door.  You will see the fuse panel on side of dash.  Take the door off (you have to pull pretty hard sometimes).  Once the door is off there is a red reset button in there.  Turn the key forward to the on position (don't start it).  then tap the reset button once and the change oil light on the dash should start to blink.  Once the light blinks hold down the reset button until you hear three beeps or the door chimer will ding.  you also reset the tire monitor the same way.  You just press the button twice (first time oil light will blink second tap and tire light will flash) once the tire light is flashing hold down again until it beeps or dings. <SEP> How do you reset the oil light on a 2002 pontaic grand am? <EOS>
Check that the vent outside (especially in northern climates this time of the year). Then check the hose that goes from the drier to the outside vent. Finally, check the drier itself, that there is no obstructions getting to the hose. Check the lint trap. Is it full or is it installed properly? If all this checks out, then try replacing the heating element. These are usually inexpensive, and fairly easy to replace.

When Good Transmissions Go Bad By Heather Madigan & Carolyn MartellCarPrices.com  The word transmission conjures up dread, perhaps even fear. Especially when your mechanic starts to utter, "I think your transmission is . . ." Your brain is attacked violently by the image of your checkbook being sucked empty by a greedy vacuum. The money you had been saving to go on vacation, or to buy that new computer, ultimately will dwindle to nothing now that there is something wrong with your transmission.Instead of having to succumb every ounce of your savings to a mechanic, maybe you can diffuse some transmission problems before they set in. The solution is called preventive maintenance, and it comes highly recommended by manufacturers, dealers, mechanics and generally everybody who has a car or knows about them.The damage done to a transmission can be catastrophic to your lifestyle, at best. For one thing, while your car sits in the shop, you must get a ride wherever you want to go -- Grrr! And then there's that little matter of money: Rebuilding a transmission is estimated at around $2,150. That's some pretty major incentive to try to maintain the transmission as best you can.The basics are a good place to start. The transmission propels the car forward. It is a mechanism that transfers the power produced by the engine, ultimately to spin the wheels of the vehicle. The transmission operates under tremendous heat, therefore it is vital that the fluids are maintained and that extra caution is taken when driving in extreme conditions, such as harsh winter weather or hauling heavy loads. The transmission, however, can overheat by normal driving, pushing the fluid temperatures well beyond safe limits.According to the Automatic Transmission Rebuilds Association, overheating causes 90 percent of all transmission failures. Most of these can be blamed on worn-out fluid that should have been replaced. Check your transmission fluid level regularly, and actually smell it to find out if it has a burnt odor. If it does smell burnt, it needs to be changed. Refer to your car manual to find out specific mileage/time intervals to check and change the fluid, which varies from car to car. Every 30,000 to 50,000 miles is a good number to keep in mind. Performing this sooner will not hurt anything though.If there is a reddish leak under your vehicle, this could spell bad news. It's usually the automatic transmission fluid. It is vital at this point to check the fluid level more frequently. Whatever you do, do not allow that fluid to run low! The transmission will heat up, breaking down the fluid's ability to lubricate and cool. This will increase friction and heat, which will wear out the transmission prematurely. Use the transmission fluid that is recommended in the car manual or printed on the dipstick. Using the wrong type of fluid can affect the way the transmission shifts and feels, causing it to shift too harshly or slip under heavy loads.Getting the vehicle stuck in mud or snow can cause another potential hazard to the transmission -- as well as the whole vehicle, seeing as how it is stuck somewhere. It always is suggested that you dig your vehicle out or get towed vs. the alternative. And at one time or another, we all have seen -- or perhaps resorted to -- the jump-on-the-bumper method to gain traction to rock the vehicle free. This can shock the transmission more than it can handle, and internal parts can start to break.The life of any automobile is extended when it is taken care of properly. So, what if you do change the fluids and keep up on the fluid levels, and it still overheats? Remember, this is a machine and machines break. Do what you can to keep your transmission in good health by performing regularly scheduled maintenance checks. There isn't much more you can do other than hiding the vehicle in the garage, and that's no fun! <SEP> How to tell if your vehicles transmission is bad? I have a 1993 nissan pathfinder <EOS>
I'm no expert, but generally speaking, a finer-toothed saw will make cleaner cuts (and slower ones ;-) ).  Among hand tools, I'd try a hack saw; for handheld power tools, a fine-toothed circle saw or perhaps one of those "super disks"; and for table-based power tools, a band saw.  Either way, take your time.By the way, if you've got significant excess length, you can always practice a couple of different approaches before making the final cut. <SEP> How can I make a clean cut in something that is both metal and wood?

No offense to the previous answers but "Don't try to re-invent THE WHEEL"   Follow prescribed instructions.   Alternating tightening of the two bolts is a good idea.   Make certain the tank was seated properly to begin with, and the nuts threaded without cross threading. The metal washers are designed to prevent damage to the rubber washers under,,,or above them. The washers,,, or at least one of them should act as a flange type thing that seats in the bolt hole and expands to fill the hole as the nut is tightened.    Having them tightened but out of balance with each other will often cause an improper seating of one or both sides.   Drain and remove the tank. Check the condition of the hardware, perhaps buying new. Check the condition of the exit hole and the seal for it. Re- seat the tank, add the bolt with the metal washer added first, then the sealing washer. Under the tank add the rubber washer, metal washer, and nut. Tighten to what seems to be a point of some resisitence, perhaps as you can see the bottom rubber washer begin to expand a bit in its compression. Refill the tank just enough to check for leaks, and if you notice any, then tighten a half or quarter turn equally on each nut until the leaking stops.   Unless the tank or its main sealing holes have been corrupted, the leaking should vanish.Rev. Steven <SEP> How do I prevent leakage around the bolts holding the toliet tank to the toliet bowl? I purchased a kit which contained new bolts, 4 flat washers, 4 rubber washers and 4 nuts.

I tightened the first nut to a point that I was afraid to tighten it any more in fear I would crack the tank.  I tightened the second nut until the tank fully contacted the base and would not wobble. <EOS>

Many different places sell the actual hitch and some also install them.  First you need to determine what Class you need.

The Class II Hitch has a Weight Carrying Capacity of 3500 lbs and the Class III/IV Hitch has a Weight Carrying Capacity of 5000 lbs.  How much weight you will be pulling with the hitch determines which you will need.  There are many tricks involved in installing the hitch also.

Installing Vinyl Siding - Making It Simple by Colin McDougall Installing vinyl siding can be a very rewarding process that could dramatically change the appearance of your home. For the most part, if you plan your job well and adhere to some simple guide lines, anyone could learn how to install siding to there home. The first thing to consider when installing vinyl siding is what tools will be needed for the job. Basically with some common carpenter tools, like a, hammer, level, chalk line, screw driver set, tin snips and a good circular saw you can pretty much achieve what it is you need to do. But if you plan on making a profession out of it, expect to pay in the thousands for a properly equipped truck. After you have gathered your tools, you will need to collect your materials to prepare the job. Below you will find a list of some fundamental items needed to start your siding project. Sheathing/BackerboardVinyl siding should be applied over a sheathing that provides a smooth, flat surface. Since every district has different code requirements you may want to consult local building codes for sheathing requirements. Vinyl siding should never be applied directly to framing studs without sheathing. As an alternative to backer board, there is a variety of specific types of contoured foam under lays available for various styles of vinyl siding. Weather Resistant BarrierVinyl siding should be installed over a continuous weather resistant barrier to stop the intrusion of incidental water. Weather resistant barrier systems commonly consist of a combination of exterior cladding, flashed wall openings and penetrations, weather resistant barrier material, and sheathing. Commonly used is black carpentry felt. When using felt be sure to check thickness requirements. Flashing Code-compliant flashing should be integrated with the weather resistant barrier and applied around windows, doors, and other openings. Flashing should also be applied to inside and outside corners, and the intersection of walls and roofing to prevent water seepage through the joints. Once your outside wall has been covered with sheathing to provide a smooth flat surface, and your windows and doors have had flashing installed to channel any incidental water from collecting, you may now install the starter strip. This strip is an accessory applied directly to the surface of the building at the lowest part of the wall to be sided, and is used to secure the first course of siding to the home. This course will need to be checked for level as it is what the rest of the job relies upon for evenness. With aluminum, galvanized steel, or other corrosion-resistant nails, you may now start installing the vinyl siding. As each style of panel may be different refer to installation instructions supplied. Cut the panels to length with a circular saw and trim with tin snips. As you nail the panels in place, be sure to leave about the thickness of as dime between the nail head and wall to allow for shifting. Check every 5th or 6th course for horizontal alignment. When portions overlap you must have about 1" to seal the joint. The basic installation of vinyl siding is quite simple, but since there are codes governing how certain aspects are handled, you should inquire with a professional for specific trimming tasks and other more complicated vinyl siding installation practices. All in all, you will find the task of re-siding your home manageable with only a few frustrations to contend with. But the reward will be well worth it.

if you want factory wiring along with your new aftermarket radio, then you need wiring harness adapter that go along with the type of stero you got.  that way you dont have to cut into any wire which you have no clue of.  that would be the easliest way to get it done.  if you prefer to save some money without buying the adapter, then you need to cut into the factory wiring.  for that 1st need to know which wires are for power. 2nd which are for speakers.  most people think power is usually red but can be different or a mixture of different colors. instead of assume which wire is which.  do it with a multimeter, that would help without burning the fuses.  identify which are speaker wires.  move them aside, you are left with power, ground, antennna etc.  to find the power that mean +12vdc, hook up the meter with black probe touching the chasis or the car.  with key on engine off, the red probe of the meter would be use to test out which is the hot wire.  you would go through the few wires until you know which one is which is +12vdc.  once you get power, ground, antenna figure out, then everything else is easy.  hope that helps <SEP> how to install an aftermarket radio in a 1997 ford taurus sho? <EOS>

Remove the caliper then the caliper bracket. The rotor should com off easily. You may need to "whop it" with a hammer to unstick the dirt and rust.

If the flooring is new and not worn then you may have soap build up which can dull hard floor finishes.  Mopping is fine only if you are using a wood floor mop.  They can be found in any hardware store, Wal-mart etc.  They are a flat version of a mop and use less water.  you should never use excess water on wood floors.  I have seen many wood floors damaged this way.  You could try to rinse with just plain water to remove build up or use water with some white vinegar (vinegar is acidic and an effective way to rinse soap build up & a good home remedy) you can also buy a store bought rinsing agent which would be a higher grade acidic cleaner.  If your floor is dull due to wear there are some products you can buy off the shelf to restore wood floors that are inexpensive but they are really just short term solutions, they usualy are a wax of some kind.  The best way to get the shine back of a worn wood floor is to sand and re-finish.  Which is best left to a pro unless you are very handy (then you can rent everything nessesary at most hardware stores).As for on going maintenance for hard floors, do not use excess soap and only use a neutral soap, better yet clean often using only water or very little soap.  Using the wood floor mop and not too much water.  If possible sweep or vacuum the floor before mopping. <SEP> How do i maintain, clean and manage my parquay flooring??? the parquay in my new house has lost some of its shine of late. is mopping good for this kind of flooring? <EOS>
HONEST ANSWERS.......Here goes.......Do you both rent? That would make things real simple. Being a Landlord myself, I know of what you speak.That's how they happen, a bathroom leak usually comes down in the downstairs living room, sometimes their small because if the drywall is solid or even new, water will actually sit in a puddle, depending on the size of the leak. First of all, go down there and tell him to show you the damage, usually the ceiling below the leak will be stained, kinda brown, from the drywall being wet. Before you do that,flush your toilet,make sure everything is quiet, listen for running water or drips. That kind of damage can be real bad,if there is water, it will soak the drywall, eventually it could all come down. Like I said in the beginning, if you both rent, it's the landlords problem, if he owns the house, make sure you see it, if you can't do it, get someone YOU KNOW to take care of it.......Hit Answers up again, I'll be looking for you.

It is also possible to use Google Apps Scripts to achieve automatic in-place sorting of the data.  This may be more difficult to achieve and more error-prone (I'd still go for William Jackson's solution, +1 BTW), but I thought it was interesting enough to show.  I have a sheet that looks like this:   I added a new script, using these steps:   in the menu, go to Tools -> Script Editor...  select Create a new project  in the empty code window that appears, paste the following code, which will be run automatically whenever a cell is edited:  function onEdit(event){   var sheet = event.source.getActiveSheet();   var editedCell = sheet.getActiveCell();    var columnToSortBy = 4;   var tableRange = "B3:E9";    if(editedCell.getColumn() == columnToSortBy){        var range = sheet.getRange(tableRange);     range.sort( { column : columnToSortBy } );   } }  go back to the sheet and start playing around with the values to see the table sort automatically each time   Note:  In the above script,   the value 4 represents the index of column D (the Value column - the on that's going to be sorted)  the value "B3:E9" represents the table range (excluding the header row)   Your table will most likely differ from mine, so these values should be adjusted accordingly. <SEP> How can I make some data on a Google Spreadsheet auto-sorting? <EOS>

Here are two articles about changes Google has made to search which affect required terms. First Google started silently ignoring some of the search terms included in multiple term searches (making all search terms required by default was one of the reasons I originally liked Google better than Yahoo). Then more recently they stopped supporting the "+" to force term inclusion, apparently because they want to use that in searches involving Google+.  Google Just Made Bing the Best Search Engine  Google Kills Its Other Plus, and How to Bring It Back  In years past, I could have searched for things like the following and only gotten pages that had all these terms:   bengals highlights simpson   I would only double-quote exact phrases I wanted matched, such as "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"  When I noticed the first change above several months ago, I started using the + operator, which had been previously redundant:   +bengals +highlights +simpson   Now it appears we have to separately double-quote each term we require which is a pain:   "bengals" "highlights" "simpson" <SEP> Force Google search to use only the exact words typed, no spellcheck or synonyms <EOS>

I will agree with just about every body's answer.  Most pump on whirlpools are nylon impellers or bronze, which both of them should not produce rust.  If your water heater is rusting out it could be the problem, draining will only last a while.  If you happen to have galvanized pipe of a piece of black pipe in you water system this could cause rust. If you go to other fixtures in your house and get rust out of them it could be that.  It could also be from the water main it self, which is a city or if your on a well a problem at the source.

I think you are talking about what to do for the wood on the bottom of the cabinet.  First, make sure you get the plumbing repaired first.  Simply replace the drain pipes under the sink.  I recommend replacing everything.  The parts are cheap and it is a lot easier to do it all.Seconds, using a jig saw or sawz-all (can rent at a tool rental place), cut the bottom of the cabinet out, leaving a few inches around the outside edges.  Cut a piece of plywood that fits inside the cabinet.  Set the plywood on the lip that you left when you cut the old base out.

There is a problem with the microswitches on the Ford Taurus / Mercury Sable - I replaced them on a customer car at my shop a couple of months ago. The part number for the Door Jamb Switches from the Ford Dealer is SW-5528.  List is somewhere around $15 each I think, and it takes about 30 minutes per door to fix.  The trick is figuring out which door needs the switch - some sources recommend replacing them all, but if you open up the door and unplug the switch (it is actually in the door latch mechanism so you have to remove the inside door trim) the light will go out - try it on each door until you figure out which one is bad. <SEP> how do you get the interior lights to shut off on a 99 mercury sable? <EOS>

My wife and I moved from the US to Ireland.  Just before we came, my wife bought a water filter to use over here in Ireland.

I am assuming you have laminate on plywood or MDF that you want to salvage discarding only the laminate.If the old laminate is loose due to bad contact cement application. initially it might be easy. Otherwise a lot of scraping is in your future.The hardest part is to get off the old laminate and any cement underneath it. If it is loose try sliding a paint scraper under it and prying up gradually. If not tap the scraper under the edging and try to get that off first with prying. Then start on the top sheet of laminate and slip the scraper under it and pry it. Repeat until all the laminate is off. Next look at the cement left on the plywood surface. Clean it off with a sanding block of about 200 grit.When cement is gone and laminate is in the dumpster, just get the new laminate, new contact cement, roller, some newspapers, and  either a router or a laminate trimmer.

I'm not sure if what I've encountered is the same as you are asking about, but here goes.On older basement windows, metal sash, the glass is held in by spring clips that are roughly in the shape of a capital "A"Lower legs of the "A" fit either into holes in the sash that are pre-drilled for them, or are squeezed into elongated slots. Often the holes are hidden by a residue of old putty.The glass is placed into the sash on a bedding of glazing putty, springs are inserted to hold it in place, and then more putty is tooled onto the edges, covering the springs. The putty serves to prevent breakage from vibration and to provide an air seal.If you have some other design, add it in details and I'll see what I can do. <SEP> how  does the spring clip go into the frame of a metal casement window when replacing the glass? <EOS>

Look for a clean out by the side of the building. Try taking a metal rod(4 or 5 foot long) working your way out from the building, poke down in the ground, with some luck it will be shallow enough to be detected when the rod won't go down. If you can get a sewer rod and go down the clean out until it stop you should stop where it enter the septic tank.

I just did some repairs to some lath and plaster this morning. You need to pick off any "loose" pieces at the edges of your existing hole. Your 1 foot by 3 foot repair may become larger! It's tough to know when to stop. When you feel you have removed the most loose pieces, it's time to start the repair. You need to purchase some "setting type" joint compound. It comes in a powder that you add water to, and mix to a consistancy that is slightly thinner than peanut butter. It should'nt sag when applied to the wall. Fill the area and put some mesh tape over the edges. The joint compound that you purchase should be a 90 minute setting type. This means it will be dry within that time and you can reapply some more to finish it. I would also suggest using a regular joint compound to "feather out" and finish the area. It's easier to sand. This job is a little tricky. It takes alot of practice to get familiar with the tools and to get a good feel for the material. If you apply the joint compound evenly and smooth at each coat, you should have minimal sanding only after the last coat is applied.   Good luck  (If you have to remove to much plaster I would suggest screwing on a piece of 1/4 inch drywll in the area.) <SEP> How do I repair a lathe and plaster wall?

From what I understand, wood species commonly pressure-treated in the southeast US doesn't need injection holes.  That may be why Untouchable has never seen them.  The species used in the west (where I live) DO need injection holes (staggered parallel rows of half-inch long cuts).  Most PT stuff here is over-dyed brown, to get rid of the green tint from the chemicals.  And wood treated with CCA is no longer legal to sell in the US.  ACQ is a common substitute.  The new PT chemicals are more caustic than CCA, and require use of fasteners, straps and brackets with thicker layers of galvanizing.  Just replace everything--you'll take a big risk leaving the old stuff in place, and won't save much money.  The building codes in your area should be designed to prevent termite infestation, requiring metal shielding and no wood-to-earth connections, for example.  Follow them. <SEP> How do I know if something was built with pressure treated wood? I just bought a house with a deck. Now I find out there is termites in the wood.

Kiddo that is a hell of a good question! Not is is not only women that get the shaft!

Then compare them.I've been burned myself and I normally do 95% of my own work.Another way is to getting to know people at the parts dealers in the area like Auto Zone, Napa and O'Relly's they usually know who the good/ honest mechanics are in the area and who not to take your car to. <SEP> How does a woman find an HONEST auto mechanic?

First you have to jack up the car and support it with jackstands remove the wheels and the center axle nuts (do this before removing the brake calipers so someone can hold the brake for you to get them loose). On some cars it is possible to leave the calipers and rotors onbut not all the time. Next seperate the outer tie rod and ball joint and ush down on the a arm with a large pry bar to swing the strut out of the way. Next pull the axle out of the spindle, It might have to be tapped with a hammer to break it loose. After it is out of the spindle you can try pulling the axle out of the transmission by yanking on it a couple of times but it generally wont be that easy you will have to get under the car with a pry bar and pry it loose from the tranny. Be careful not to pry against the seal in the tranny. Also transmission fluid might come pouring out of the tranny when the axle is removed so dont lay directly under it and have a drain pan ready. To remove the transmission you are probably going to have to take it out the bottom. At this stage you can remove the torque converter bolts, tranny mounts, exhaust, shift cables, wiring, speedometer cable if you have one, and bell housing bolts. Then you can soosten the subframe bols on the engine side about half way out and with a floor jack support the tranny side of the frame and remove the sub frame bolts on that side. Slowly let the subframe down about 6 inches and stop look at your motor and make sure that nothing is binding. If it looks like the transmission will slide out under the body you can then support the motor with a piece of wood running from one strut tower to the other and a strap from that piece of wood to the motor. I like to use a 4x4 for this because it is strong enough. After the motor has been supported you can let the subframe down more and pull the transmission up off of the subframe and out from under the car. Also pay special attension to the dipstick tube it might have to be removed to do this. <SEP> how do i re move axils from a fwd car? i want to take out the trany only <EOS>
High voltage electricity (anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 volts) is supplied to the to the spark plug by the ignition system.  The spark plug has an insulated passageway for this high voltage to travel to the electrode, where it can jump the gap and create a spark,  similar to a bolt of lightning. This ignites the compressed fuel/air mixture, causing the expanding gases to force the piston down. This process converts the chemical energy stored in the fuel to mechanical energy. <SEP> How does spark plug works? <EOS>
The Chevy Nova 1986 is basically a 1986 Toyota Corolla and it has a toyota engine in it.I recommend getting an Haynes Manual if you want to do this yourself. It is not an easy task. and unless you are really mechanically inclined I WOULDN'T recommend you do it yourself unless you've got a good manual and a friend who has done a timing belt. Typical steps to replacing a timing belt.1. Disconnect battery.2. Remove all accessory belts. (various means).3. Remove the harmonic balance. (On the crank shaft that was driving all the accessory belts. Usually the hardest part for me of a timing belt change.4. You may have to open the flywheel/flex plate inspection area or remove the starter motor and jam a screw driver into the flex plate to prevent the crank shaft from turning as you try to remove this bolt.5. Remove the timing belt covers. Typically an upper and lower cover.6. If necessary you may have to remove an engine mount as I recall the engine is a transverse mounted engine. If this is the case you'll have to support that part of the engine with a floor jack and preferably a piece of wood or something that won't punch through your oil pan. Or you can use an engine hoist from the top.7. Now align the crank shaft and cam shaft(s) to Top Dead Center (TDC) for cylinder 1. Usually there's marks on both the cam and crank shaft to indicate when you are at TDC.I believe the cam shaft has an arrow on it that must align with an arrow on the housing to indicate TDC.8. Now look for a pulley that is applying pressure to the timing belt, but can be loosened and be pushed against to loosen the timing belt.9. Remove timing belt.10. Install new timing belt.11. Release the tensioning pully so that it is applying tension.12. Tighten the tensioning pully in place.13. VERY IMPORTANT. CHECK to be sure you didn't mess up the synchronization between the cam shaft and crank shaft. So after re-applying the tensioner's pressure. You must try to turn the crank shaft two rotations and check cam shaft location. They should be the same as before. If not, your crank and cam shaft have gotten out of synchronization and you must take the timing belt off and re-sync them.If everything is in sync, then re-install everything in the reverse order.That's the short version of how to do a timing belt. Typically you can get through the entire job with a good ratchet set, a few screwdrivers and a nice set of wrenches. No other speciality tools are typically necessary unless of course you strip a bolt.Good luck. <SEP> how do I replace the timing belt on a 1986 chevy nova? <EOS>

I am not a mechanic, but I did change an o2 sensor on a my 92 maxima once.  What you need is to call your local dealer's parts department and ask them for the directions to change the o2 sensor from their repair manual.

Otherwise you can buy the repair manual and o2 sensor from them if need be or of course a auto parts store such as Autozone usually carries both items.

I have an older 1989 model GE oven that I am trying to order a part for, but it does not have a model number tag on it.  Is there any way to find out what model numbers were produced in 1988 or 1989?  Also, I have a part number, but cannot find anyone to supply the part.

The best way to check the condition of the manual transmission is take out the drain plug. Be sure to catch the fluid in a clean container since you are using synthetics. The drain plug should be magnetic on the tip. If it is not, you should replace it with one that is.It serves two purposes, 1) to easily see if there is excess metal in the transmission and 2) there will all ways be some bits of metal thrown off by the gears and the magnet captures it and keeps it at the bottom of the sump so it does not act as an abrassiveto cause damage to the bearings and bushings.The clutch is a wear item and with 400 Hp you will know when the clutch is wearing thin...it will start to slip..probably in 3rd or 4th gears to begin with that much Hp and you will notice "feel" of the clutch pedal gets very narrow on engagement. <SEP> How can I tell the health of my manual transmission?

Here's How:1.   Wear rubber gloves and eye protection while cleaning cast iron since the methods require using caustic chemicals.2.   Begin by spraying the pan with oven cleaner and putting it in a plastic bag.3.   After a day or two, take it out of the bag and scrub it down with a brass brush.4.   If all the grease doesn't loosen up right away, repeat the process concentrating cleaner on stubborn spots.5.   If you have several dirty items, soak them in a solution of one and a half gallons of water to one can of lye mixed in a plastic container.6.   Allow them to soak for about five days, then remove the pieces and use the same brass brush method to scrub them clean.7.   Removing mild rust should be done with a fine wire wheel on an electric drill.8.   Crusted rust can be dissolved by soaking the piece in a 50 percent solution of white vinegar and water for a few hours.9.   Once the pan's clean, begin the seasoning process by warming it in the oven for a few minutes then applying a little shortenting, vegetable cooking spray, lard or bacon fat.10.   Put the skillet back into a 225 degree oven for 30 minutes. Remove and wipe it almost dry to eliminate any pooled grease.11.   Place the pan in the oven for another half hour or so, completing the initial seasoning.12.   The seasoning process will continue with use, especially if you use it to cook fatty foods (bacon, sausage, fried foods, etc.) the first few times it hits the stove.13.   To clean after cooking, boil hot water in the pan. Let it soak for several minutes and then wipe dry with a paper towel.14.   Reheat the pan and apply just enough grease to wet the surface before storing.Tips:Use the methods above only for cleaning iron.Don't soak pans in a vinegar solution more than overnight without checking them because the solution will eventually eat the iron.After cooking, do not use detergent or scouring pads to clean a cast iron pan since this will destroy the seasoning.What You Need:Rubber glovesEye protectionSpray oven cleanerLarge plastic zip bagBrass brush <SEP> how do you remove baked on grease from a cast iron skillet, and  what is the best way to maintain? <EOS>

lift the vehicle in the rear and put the rear end on jack stands.  remove the cover on the rear differential. make sure there is a drain pan under it because it will make a mess.  once the cover is removed rotate the ring gear around(the transmission will have to be in neutral) until you see a 5/16" bolt in the side of the carrier assembly from the passenger side of the vehicle. remove that bolt(it will be very tight).  once the bolt is removed the center pin will slide out of the carrier assembly.  make sure the tire and brake drum are removed from the side you want to change.  push the axle on the desired side in. now that the center pin is removed the axle will move inward and there is a horse shoe shaped clip that will fall off of the end of the axle and the spider gear.  the axle is then free to be removed.  reverse procedure to install.

I f you take your time and are particular to make a good job tiling is remarkably easy, just remember to tack a level wooden batten to the wall for your first tile to sit on and then when the wall is tiled remove the batten and tile in the space below, the reason for this is that no room is square and it looks really bad if you end up with a sliver of tile or a gap filled with grout, so always space your tiles first see how it looks and then start with a half tile on the horizontal and vertical, never ever start with a full tile, as if you start with a half you can make your tiles go bigger and smaller with the wall, try to make sure that where the tile edges meet each other they are fairly level( if they are not just pull the tile out where necessary) and not dipping in or proud of each other as you dont want any brown edges of the tiles showing through the grout having said that grouting hides a multitude of sins,clean off any adhesive as soon as possible, take special care and after a day grout it, only do small sections at a time say two foot square as grout sets quick on a dry joint, when you have grouted a small area then take a grouting tool or the round end of a pencil will do and rub the joints, clean with a almost dry sponge then rub joints again filling in any pin holes then clean again, repeat for the rest of the wall. If the wall is very bad, before you tile you could always level the wall with plasterboard or some waterproof equivalent. Always use waterproof adhesive and grout,  .im not a tiler I am a plasterer but recently have been doing a fair bit of tiling and although a little slow and fussy I have been delighted with the results its much easier than you might think. <SEP> How to set tile? <EOS>

Most showerheads hand-screw off. My showerhead is like that. However, be careful when you unscrew it. Make sure you have a pipe wrench and clamp the pipe (where the showerhead connects to) tight. You don't want to turn or break the pipe that's sticking out of the wall. You can get teflon/plumbers tape at Home Depot. Make sure you put at least 1-2 layers of the tape around the threads in the pipe before installing the new showerhead. This will help against leaks. Again, don't forget the pipe wrench and hold the pipe while screwing in the showerhead.Here is a link I found on the DIY webpage:http://www.diynetwork.com/diy/ba_faucets_fixtures/article/0,2037,DIY_13710_2272541,00.html <SEP> How do I replace my showerhead? <EOS>
Start with gathering some information, from your owner manual or perhaps asking at the parts store.You need to know what grade and quantity of oil you need, such as 5 quarts of 5W30 motor oil.  For some cars, like VW's, Mercedes and BMW's, there may be some special oil specifications your new oil must meet, so make sure you are aware of those as well as the quantity.Also, make sure you learn if the capcity include the filter or not.  If not, find out how much oil you must add when you change the filter.  It's probably not more than 1 quart.Find out what filter you need.Finally, do you need a new crush washer for the drain plug.  Some cars have a crush washer that is supposed to be replaced during the oil change.You will need to gather:Tools, such as an oil filter wrench as well as a drain pan for the oil and a wrench or socket set for the oil.Oh, cheap kitty litter is good for soaking up any spilled oil if you should miss the drain pan.You will need rags to wipe your hands and a clean rag to check the oil.  You will probably also need a funnel and perhaps ramps or a jack and jackstands to raise the car.  Do not work on the car sitting on a jack only, use jackstands.Take a drive, getting the car warm and then return to where you are going to change the oil and raise the car.  Driving to the parts store to get any items you need and returning should be sufficient.Once you have the car up, locate the drain plug on the oil pan.  The oil pan should be at the bottom of the engine. If you cannot tell the engine from any other part, quit now, this is not a job for you.Being careful, since the oil could be close to 200F, place the oil pan beneath the drain plug, allowing some room for the oil to shoot out from the drain.  It may go as much as a foot or so from the opening, so plan accordingly.Carefully remove the drain plug from the pan.  It's a good idea to wear gloves, so you don't get burned by the hot oil.Hang on to the drain plug, or you'll be fishing it out of the drain pan.Remove the filler cap, it will help the crankcase drain.Go have a beverage, call a friend, surf the web a while, give your car 10-15 minutes to drain most of the oil.Now, return the drain plug when the oil is finished draining.  If you need a new crush washer, install it when you re-install the drain plug.Move your drain pan under the oil filter.  Look at the new filter to see what shape and size this item is.  Your old one may be a different color and will certainly be dirty, so don't count on color helping you here.I can often get them off with my bare hands, but if you need to, use the oil filter wrench to remove the old filter.  Drain the old filter into the pan.You may want to take some time and wipe up any spilled oil from your car.  When you remove the oil filter, you probably will spill oil on the car.  Just wipe it off.To install the new oil filter you need two things, new clean oil and your hands.  If your oil filter is vertical, with the opening at the top, it would be good to pre-fill the filter with some oil.  If your filter mounts sideways or the filter mounts with the opening facing down, don't worry, this is an optional nice touch.Put a small amount of clean oil on the gasket.  Make sure the old filter gasket is on the filter and not still on your engine.  Hand tighten the new filter.  Once the filter makes contact, tighten it 1/2 to 3/4 of an additional turn.  It should say how far.  Hand tighten, too tight and you won't get it off again, or it will crush the gasket and leak.Now, fill the engine with the oil change quantity of oil at the filler cap.  If this is the first time changing oil for this engine, I would not add the quantity specified for the filter until you can check the oil level.  Check the oil, if you can see new, clean oil on the dipstick, you probably have enough to start the car at this point.  Otherwis <SEP> how do you change oil? <EOS>

Your problem is the main drain and NOT the P-Trap. If it was only the P-trap then the neighbor wouldn't be having a problem. Both your drains may meet behind the wall before they go into the drain pipe. If that's the case there may be a problem behind the wall and that is the landlords problem. Unless you want what you dropped down I wouldn't worry about taking apart your p-trap. The landlord should send someone to the roof to drop a snake down the drain vent and remove the clog. Should you want to remove the p-trap you will need an adjustable wrench to remove the two nuts that hold it in place. You may want to go to a home store or plumbers shop and buy another p-trap if it looks nasty because it might fall apart when you try to remove the nuts. You will need an 11/2" for the kitchen and 1 1/4 for a bathroom. BE AWARE THAT WHEN YOU REMOVE IT ALL THE WATER THAT IS BACKED UP INTO THE DRAIN PIPE IS GOING TO START GUSHING OUT OF THE PIPE.

According to our leases we are responsible for the plumbing bill if we caused the problem!! Neither she nor I can afford large plumbing expense.  I was told by a friend that since the trap is metal (galvinized) it would be easy to repacel due to the fact that it is not only clogged but  also probably quite corroded.

The reason ice dams form is because there is heat getting into your attic. This melts the snow on your roof which re-freezes when it gets down to the colder eaves. This can cause leaks as the ice can actually back up under the shingles. You need a good insulation blanket on the floor of your attic or, if insulating the rafters, make sure to install styrofoam baffles that will allow cold air to circulate between the roof sheathing and insulation. Ideally, you only want the snow to melt because it's warm outside, not because your attic is warm, this reduces the chance of a re-freeze at the eaves.A tell tale sign of poor attic insulation is when you look at a roof and can see the rafter lines because they're still covered in snow while the spaces between the rafters has melted. <SEP> how do i stop icicles & ice buildup on the edge of my house roof? <EOS>

This new answer works if one of the other recipients has a top level domain that is common-ish and different from yours.  Aaron's answer appears not to work, for two reasons.  The first is that google does not implement wild cards in gmail ( Wildcard search in Gmail ). The second reason is that, from experience, I find the search considers BOTH conjuncts, to:me and, say, -to:com .  It's easy to check by entering to:me -to:com in the search bar, and finding that nothing sent to your gmail.com address is there.  From the question I linked above we know that you need to search tokens; e.g., top level domains like .com and .org. But we know we can't just do  to:me to:(-com -org -edu -gov -uk -net -ca -de -jp -fr -au -us -ru -ch -it -nl -se -no -es -mil)  As an aside, don't try and putting ALL top level domains in, as the search will be rejected for length.  I got the above list from This blog post about common TLDs .  There is one more thing to deal with, and that is the empty to: field.  My work around is to use is:important to limit the intrusion of these.  Gmail complained when I tried to make a filter with this flag, but it did properly filter a new (important) email to me.  So, we come to my answer, where my own top level domains are .com and .uk (.ac.uk, but the .uk is a token in itself):  is:important to:((-com OR me) -coop -org -edu -gov (-uk OR me) -net -ca -de -jp -fr -au -us -ru -ch -it -nl -se -no -es -mil)  This enforces the following two properties:  1. Emails to anyone with a listed domain different from yours are rejected  2. If an email has one of your domains, it must be (at least) to you.  In a similar manner, you can add specific email addresses that you commonly receive email together with you by adding something like -<coworker@yourdomain.com> <SEP> How can I set a Gmail filter that finds email sent “only to me”? <EOS>

You can buy some sheetrock at a lumber yard or home improvement center (or maybe even pick up some free scraps). Cut it with a utility knife to size and screw pieces in place with dry wall screws to replace the crumbled plaster. You may have to remove more plaster to expose the studs, which are the best places to screw the sheetrock to (I'm assuming you are talking about lath (wooden strips) and plaster in your wall; if what's crumbling is sheetrock (hard plaster between two sheets of paper), then just cut out the bad parts with a utility knife, back to a stud. After you've screwed on the new sheetrock pieces, use joint compound to plaster up the gaps. If you've just got small holes, you can just use joint compound to fill them up. You could also just apply joint compound over big areas of lath, but I find for larger gaps that it works better to screw up a piece of sheetrock to cover most of the hole, then patch up the edges. If your crumbling wall is sheetrock, measure the thickness of it so you can buy the same thickness. If it's lathe and plaster, measure the thickness from the surface of the lathe to the surface of the plaster.Also note that joint compound  shrinks when it dries. Its best to apply it to the holes, smoothing with a putty knife, let it completely dry (a day), then do it again (it will have cracked and sunk in spots). Professionals also use joint tape, but this seems overkill since the repair will be hidden behind a baseboard. <SEP> How do I go about fixing holes in plaster walls?

First, go to radio shack and purchase a phone line tester for $5.19Then unplug Every device that plugs into a phone line and test the jack with the device. Draw a map of the rooms in the house and mark the working and non working jacks on it.Make sure you test all jacks including ones where other devices plug into the phone jack such as answering machines, caller ID boxes, Sat Dish receivers, Computer modems, Digital photo frames, alarm systems, "the box that you use when you have fallen and can't get up", etc.Once you look at a map of the bad jacks, you will have an idea of where to start. Phone wires are easy to check. If you have one line it is usually hooked up to the Red and Green Wires. If you have two lines, then line two is almost always on Black and Yellow. Know where all the wires come into the house.Check the non working jack that is closest to where the wires come into the house First. One wire off can knock out all the jacks after it.Make sure the wire is exactly on the one screw it is supposed to be on and does not have a chance to tough any other wire or screw.Be systematic moving from one jack to the next. It could be in the jack, or in the wire. Just because a wire does not look broken, does not mean that the wire is not broken.If this does not work, you should go to last Working Jack or jacks which are nearest the first one not working. Check that all the wires are hooked up there properly. This is not rocket science. You can do this yourself. If you can not get the phone tester, you can use the cheapest wired phone you have and plug it in as you move from jack to jack instead.Good Luck <SEP> How do I trace back phone wires to see where the disconnect is?

I'm an expert in this, stringing weed wackers.  here's what i do.    cut  the string to 6 ft and insert one end of string in the small hole on the spool.  now put spool in middle  of string and wind the 2 strings that are coming out of the spool counter clockwise until you have about 6 inches on either side of spool.  lock the ends of string in the slots, now insert the string into holes on weed eater head and turn spool in head until it locks in place.  this idea is best to follow so if you have a bump feed weed wacker you don't have to manually remove spool and unwind alittle to get more string.   hope this idea helps. feel free to rate my answer. <SEP> How to install weed trimmer string?

Do you have access to an electeric hacksaw and a welder.  If so use the hacksaw to cut like a door in the top, pry it up, then with a hammer and chisel(screwdriver) knock the insides to pieces and dump them out. Push the cut part back down and weld it back together-make sure to get it sealed so there is no exhaust leaking.    That way it will still pass the visual inspection if your area requires an emmissin inspection with your state inspection.       Be sure to cut the top though-depending on the mechanic it could cause it to fail the inspection.    A straight pipe is easier but the cat converter is required for emmissions inspection. <SEP> How do you open the catalytic converter on a 1994 s10 with a 4.3L V6? <EOS>
A few things leap to mind. First, gas in the oil is very bad. It thins the oil to the point where it is no longer lubricating the engine, and your engine will self-destruct if you run it. Second, what you now have in your engine is an explosive vapor. It can explode, or at least ignite. Third, well, there is no third, since the first two are enough to ruin your day. The problem often occurs when a mechanical fuel pump driven off the camshaft develops some kind of leak and pumps gas into the crankcase. I used to work for a VW mechanic, and I fixed this problem several times, including the part about draining rather explosive oil from the engine. It can also occur if your carburetor or fuel injection system has a problem like a stuck float needle or some other problem that is allowing fuel to be dumped into the engine. If you do not get it fixed, you will not have to worry about checking the oil, at least not in this car. Maybe the one you replace it with, but not this one. <SEP> How do I keep gasoline from leaking in to my oil?

One option to address dependencies that I've started using is leveraging the convert task to card and card link functions.  This expands on Ilari Kajaste's answer.  For example:   Create the parent card  Create a task list on the parent card - these tasks will become the child cards  Convert the tasks to cards (Click on the task to enter edit mode, click "Convert to Card" link  A new card will be created (using the same title as the converted task), and in it's activity notes will be a link back to the parent card.  I copy this link into the description or into a new checklist task for transparency - the original link may eventually be buried under later activity notes.  To tie child back to parent, click the "More" link at the bottom right hand corner of the child card and copy the shortcut link from the "Link to this Card" field  Navigate back to the parent card via the link in the activity notes (or closing the card and navigating manually) and add the child card link in the parent description, task list or other convenient place.   The owner of the parent card can check off the dependent tasks as they are completed.  This is straight forward using the links added in the last point above. Alternatively, the owner of one of the child cards can have a final task to navigate back to the parent card and check off the initial task.  A nice feature of this process is that if these child cards are later moved to another board, the links persist.  The product owner can create the relationships on a planning board, move cards willy nilly and still have easy access to and from those cards where ever they land.  Even if the manual copying / pasting of links is not completed, there will always be at least this one artifact of the original parentage in the child card.  The downside is there is at least one manual step (copying child card link to parent card) to create a solid relationship, but overall is a good alternative to the more management heavy processes such as maintaining separate "waiting" lists and describing the dependent cards. <SEP> How do you handle dependencies between cards with Trello? <EOS>
Locate the fuel line to the intake or fuel rail to the injectors. Disconnect the hose, and put a container below it to catch any fuel. Have a buddy or family member turn the key, but not enough to start the engine to rotate. If fuel is not flowing it could be the pump or fuel pump relay or fuel pump fuse. If fuel is flowing, it could be the ignition system. Like plugs, wires, distributor. Just do a process of elimination and try to save yourself some money. If you check the fusees or relays and they are good. The pump is more than likely in the fuel tank and will need to be dropped to replace. Just remember, use a quality part and do it right and do it once. Don't settle for the cheapest. The cheapest will leave you stranded on the side of the road in the rain or worse.

I figured out a way to do this for Mac users using Mac Mail and address book without needing to download extra software. This works with Mac Mail 4.6 and Address Book 5.0.3. Not sure if it works for other vers or not. This may work similarly for other IMAP Email programs like Thunderbird, but I can't vouch for that.  Here are the steps:   Set up your Gmail account in Mac Mail. Make sure the incoming mail server is "imap.gmail.com" You can find this under the toolbar>Mail>Preferences>Accounts.  In Gmail, create a Label for the emails for which you want to extract email addresses.  In Gmail, label all the emails you want per Label above.  In Gmail, go to Settings>Labels and tick off the the box for the new Label you created that says "Show in IMAP."  Restart Mac Mail so the new Gmail Label syncs.  Open Address Book. If you use Address Book for your contacts you'll need to back up your contacts because you need to delete all contacts in Address Book. I believe you can do this with File>Export>Address Book Archive. I don't use Address Book other than for exporting Gmail emails so I can't give good advice on this. Delete Address Book contacts at your own risk.  In Address Book, delete all your contacts. You should be able to do this by selecting one contact, pressing Command+a and pressing the delete key.  In Mac Mail, find your IMAP folder. There should be a column on the left side of the window with all your Mailboxes. If not go to the top toolbar, select View>Show Mailboxes or press Command+Shift+M. The IMAP folder will be toward the bottom of the column below "Reminders", "RSS", "On My Mac" etc. You should see the Name of your Gmail account you set up earlier with a dropdown arrow on the left.  In Mac Mail, click the dropdown arrow next to your mailbox. This will show you a list of folders and should show the Label you created in Gmail as a folder. Select this folder by clicking it.  In Mac Mail in the Messages window )which should now display all your emails for you Gmail Label), select all the emails in the list. Go to the top toolbar, select Messages>Add Senders to Address Book or press Shift+Command+Y. All the senders for your Gmail Label should now be in Address Book.  In Address Book you can now export contacts as vCards to use in whatever program you like by going to the toolbar and selecting File>Export>Export vCards. You can even import back into Google Contacts. If you need a CSV file, unfortunately you will need to import the vCards into another program (Google Contacts works) and re-export because you cannot export CSV from Mac Mail.   Hope this helps! It's a bit cumbersome, but works for me and is pretty easy after you do it a couple of times. <SEP> Get e-mail addresses from Gmail messages received <EOS>
Let's start with the basics...first of all are you positive you are referring to a manual transmission?  If so, then the answer is easy.  If not, read the owner's manual.  For an automatic transmission, park the vehicle on a level surface and engage the parking brake.  Start the engine and allow to warm up to normal operating temperature.  Raise the hood and look for the brightly colored dip stick near the firewall.  The transmission should be in park when checking fluid.   Also check the color and smell of the fluid.  Dark red to almost black is an indication of trouble and a burnt smell is another indication of problems.Now for the manual transmission.  There should be a small pipe-type plug on the side of the gear case.  Simply remove the plug.  If no oil runs out, add oil until it does.  When full, replace the plug.  Check the owner's manual for the correct lubricant, but I think I used to use the heavy rear-end oil (about 80wt).  Good luck. <SEP> How do you check standard transmission fluid levels?

There are a few ways to infate your suspension. First why is it low and where? In front or back or both? Oh sorry, you said fronts only, Are both low, if so your bags are leaking more then likely.Did you raise the vehicle without turning off the suspension switch in the trunk ? Or did they deflate themselves? Usually when they deflate themselves, you have a leaking airbag or line, or even a bad pump, but you said the rears inflate right? So then the pump is probably ok. You can inflate the airbag system automatically by running the engine for a while, BUT, If you have a source leak like a blown airbag, they might not re-inflate. Or use the NGS, WDS, Snap-On scanner or OTC for that fact to turn the pump on and open the air switches at the air bags. Older Lincolns had a air inflate valve on or near the pump. It looks like a tire valve stem. I not sure but I do not think that the Mark VII's have one. Do you hear the air pump running? when you turn on the Key? You can try and put a floor jack under the vehicle on the side that is low, Jack it up alittle bit, then turn the car on for a little while. This might help to raise it by themselves. Listem carefully near the air bags for an air leak. Use a soapy spray solution like your dishwashing soap mixed with water in a squirt bottle and spary the bags down and look for bubbles.

There is a small knurled nut at the bottom of the pendulum. Turn it one way to speed up the clock and the other way to slow it down. If you grasp the nut in your right hand and move your thumb from right to left, you should slow the clock down because you are making the pendulum longer. Turning it the other way shortens the pendulum and speeds the clock up.Take very small adjustments in the nut, maybe a quarter turn or less. wait half day or so to see it the adjustment is too much or too little.I usually keep my mechanical clocks a little slow because it is easier to adjust the time by moving the minute hand forward rather than stopping the clock and waiting for time to catch up.CAUTION: Never try to move the minute hand backward and do not move the hour hand at all. <SEP> How do you set a pendellum clock?

This is more useful for when you specifically want to send it to someone who is not technically inclined (i.e. you want to make it dead-easy to open), which is why I originally posted it as an answer to this question , but it works!   "Add" your .exe file to a (new) encrypted .zip file (the "inner file".)  Change the file extension from .zip to .zipx .  (Of course, other extensions probably work.  You could even make the extension .thepasswordisHuckleberry !)  "Add" the .zipx file to a (new) unencrypted .zip file (the "outer file".)  E-mail the outer (.zip) file along with the password for the inner file.   That's it.  As an added bonus, you don't even have to change the file extension.  Windows File Explorer recognizes the inner (.zipx) file as a valid .zip file, so you can just double-click it and enter the password.  This is what it looks like after opening the outer file and trying to open the inner file.  Note the .zip icon on the .zipx file.  The text file is just there as an example of how you could keep the password conveniently attached to the file, since the point of it is just to get through GMail. <SEP> How can I send a Windows executable via Gmail? <EOS>

All propane heaters create carbon monoxide as a biproduct of the combustion process.  Carbon monoxide is deadly and can kill you, by imparing the bloods ability to absorb oxygen.

If you don't want to go to Autozone for your answer. Try these steps:1) Take the rear tire off2) Take the brake calipers off, but leave the brake line fastened. Use a small piece of rope to fasten the caliper away from the work area. 3) Take the brake rotor offYou should see the workings of the parking brake by this time. It is basically like any drum brake system but smaller. Usually, there is no wear on the brake shoes because they are rarely used except for parking. Make sure there is no unusual wear on the shoes. If there is, then replace the brake shoes.If there is a problem with the parking brake, it is usually when the brake is set because the tensioner has loosened ands the shoes aren't closing on the drums. The parking brake uses a cable system that runs through a tensioner that should be located under the car along the drive axel and just ahead of rear transaxel case. The brake shoes should be completly closed when the parking brake is set and completely free when it is released. Adjust accordingly if this is not the case.

I have figured out a way to get them out via forwarding them, using a browser scripting tool call iMacros.  I think this macro will only work with Firefox 3.6 which you can get from this link .  I wont go into installing and setting either of them up, but here is the macro I used.  VERSION BUILD=7300701 RECORDER=FX TAB T=1 FRAME F=4 TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:hE&&TXT:Reply WAIT SECONDS=.5 TAG POS=1 TYPE=TEXTAREA FORM=NAME:NoFormName ATTR=NAME:to CONTENT=test@GMAIL.COM TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TABINDEX:1&&ROLE:button&&TXT:Send WAIT SECONDS=3 TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG ATTR=ALT:&&SRC:images/cleardot.gif&&CLASS:iHkD0e&&TXT: WAIT SECONDS=2  Just replace 'test@gmail.com' with the email address you want to forward to.  Now the only other key piece of advice is where to start the loop of the macro.  To do it right, you will want to create a label and assign all your gmail chats to it.  This will allow you to see your chats in chronological order and forward them that way.  Then in gmail click on the label, when the list opens it will likely open to the newest first.  Therefore, go the the last page of the labels contents.  Open the last item.  here is when you click "play loop" in iMacros.  I had 1k chats to export.  You'll notice there are "wait" statements in the code, this will give the browser time to keep up. They may need tweaking.  Also, check back every couple of minutes, because it sometimes throws an error, or tries to move to the next (newer) chat before the email has been sent.  Just click "cancel" and it will go back to the script and the email will have been sent.  If it throws any other errors during operation, you should be able to adjust the loop duration and start it again with no problems.  This has been aggravating me for so long since I switched Gmail accounts due to spam, so I am finally happy to close that account having got all my content out. <SEP> How can I export my Google chat logs? <EOS>

Then use the Google Chrome browser to go to http://m.facebook.com/messages/  Then click the person you want to see the first message with.  Now press Ctrl + Shift + J and then paste this code into the lower window that pops up, and then press Enter . It will then proceed to load old messages until it reaches the very first message. Here is the code:  setInterval(function () { document.getElementById('see_older') .getElementsByClassName('content')[0].click(); }, 500);  The above code can also be found on this website: http://jsfiddle.net/magicramki/k9gda3cu/  If you do not want to go back all the way, you will need to stop the script. In order to do that, you will first need to define it as a variable:  var myVar=setInterval(function () { document.getElementById('see_older') .getElementsByClassName('content')[0].click(); }, 500);  Then to stop it, you will simply need to enter the following command:  window.clearInterval(myVar)  You can resume the script anytime by typing the first part again.  Now once it loads everything, you have two options. You can right click anywhere on the page and choose "save as" and then save that file somewhere on your computer. Then use Google Chrome to open it when you want to view it later (won't look right in Internet Explorer). This will save the entire chat, complete with pictures and emoticons.

I would say for the average do it yourself kind of person the only "flush" you can do is take down the transmission oil pan, remove the transmission oil filter and replace it. Be sure to replace the transmission oil pan gasket too if it has one.

CLOSE, NOT ONLY DO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THE # 1 PISTON IS AT TOP DEAD CENTER (TDC).  YOU ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE IT IS ON THE COMPRESSION STROKE.  IF YOU PUT THE DISTRIBUTER BACK IN POINTING SO IT IS SET TO FIRE THE # 1 CYLINDER, AND THE PISTON IS AT TDC EXHAUST STROKE, YOU WILL BE 180 DEGREES OFF ON THE TIMING.  TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE COMPRESSION STROKE, TAKE THE PLUG OUT OF THE CYLINDER AND PUT YOUR FINGER OVER THE HOLE WHILE YOU ROTATE THE ENGINE.  YOU WILL FEEL AIR BLOWING OUT A LOT HARDER ON THE COMPRESSION STOKE THEN ON THE EXHAUST STROKE BECAUSE THE VALVES ARE CLOSED ON THE COMPRESSION STROKE, BUT THE EXHAUST VALVE IS OPEN ON THE EXHAUST STROKE SO MOST THE AIR GOES OUT THERE.  ONCE YOU HAVE FOUND THE COMPRESSION STROKE, IF YOU STILL HAVE A TIMING MARK ON THE BALANCER YOU CAN USE IT TO FIND TDC.  JUST ROTATE THE ENGINE UNTILL THE MARK LINES UP WITH THE 0 ON THE TAB.  IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE POINTER OR MARK ANYMORE, YOU CAN PUT A STRAW OR SOMETHING SOFT INTO THE CYLINDER THOUGH THE SPARK PLUG HOLE (MAKE SURE IT IS LONG ENOUGH THAT IS DOES NOT FALL IN) AND ROTATE THE ENGINE UNTILL IT IS AT IT'S HIGHEST PONT.

A small flashlight that takes doubles As is hardly worth the hassle, unless it's a mag-lite. If it is a mag-lite, unscrew and remove the butt cap, then unscrew and remove the head assembly. Now you are basically left with an open ended cylinder with the batteries stuck inside. Spray some wd-40 in both ends, let sit a few minutes, then push the batteries out with a flathead screwdriver. Once the batteries are out, use a stiff bristle brush (like a baby bottle brush) and wd-40 to thoroughly clean the interior of the flashlight, springs, and contacts.If it's a cheap plastic flashlight that only opens at the head, you can drill a small hole in the butt-end and use the same method as above. <SEP> How do I remove corroded and swollen batteries from a flashlight?

First, do not use a knife or razor. Either the paint is sticking the sash to the frame, or paint got in the window slider..sometimes when you paint windows it's not uncommon for the wood to swell also. Take a stiff glazing or putty knife and slowly work it into the edge where the sash meets the frame and work it slow, wiggle around the whole edge...in painting terms this is called "Breaking the window".... remember to pry slowly and evenly around all the edges, use your palms to press against the sash, don't bang it please...Now, when you do manage to get it open, leave them partially open as much as possible, make sure you check on them every so often as it can take two or three days for the paint to 'Cure'...I've restored many old homes, opened windows that were painted shut for years...Be patient... <SEP> how do i get my windows back open? i just hired some painters to paint them and now there glued shut. i dont want to pay $50 for them to send someone back out, so how can i do it myself <EOS>

Unclogging a Shower Drain Topic: Home Improvement > Bathroom   2004-05-14 | Post Feedback! | Send to Friend | Print Version | Send Me Responses | Related  When the drains in our house get sluggish, here's what I do. Pour some baking soda in the drain (about 1/2 cup), then about the same amount of white vinegar. Immediately pour in a couple cups of boiling water, and plunge with the plunger. This will loosen and pull up to the top any thing caught in the drain or pipe. This is especially effective with hair in the tub or shower drain. <SEP> How do you unclog a shower drain? Water has been starting to stagnate around the drain lately while I have the shower on.  What will be the best way to clean the blockage out?  I cant open the top cover to the drain so I dont have more than 1/4 an inch of space to work with.  Water drains out fine when the shower is off.  I think if I put something like draino in there it wont effect anything since draino needs to pool on top of the blockage.  Would I just be waisting draino? <EOS>
I'm not sure exactly what you mean but if you're talking about the rain water coming off your house, one way is to bury black drain tile underground and extend it several feet away from the house.  You can also connect some of the drain tile with a wye connector.  Drain tile is the black drain hose that is sold at major home supply stores.  If your yard is sloped, you can bury the drain tile so it drains away from the house in the low lying areas.  This is especially effective if you have downspouts that drain across a sidewalk.  You can bury the drain tile under the side walk and connect it directly to the vertical downspout.  One of the most effective ways to dig under a sidewalk is to use a garden hose and water pressure. They sell fittings that connect gutter to drain tile.  Drain tile is also relatively inexpensive. <SEP> How can you move rainwater underground away from the house? <EOS>

Tools required: flashlight, phillips screwdriver, maybe wire cutters#1  TURN OFF YOU POWER AT THE FUSE BOX!!!!!!!!!#2  Remove old plate (should be really easy since the screws are missing!)#3  There should be 2 or possible 3 screws in the "guts" part of the switch.  One is silver, one is gold and might have one that is green.#4  Undo these screws and remove all of the parts to the old switch.  You should be left with 2 or 3 wires sticking out of the wall.#5 Install the new switch by attaching the white wire to the silver screw, black wire to the gold screw and green wire to the green screw - do not be alarmed if there is no green screw, this is only the ground wire and isn't required to have it function. (most old houses will not have them.)EASY TIP - you should already have the wires ready to attach to the new hardware, but if the wires are in bad condition (the individual copper wires are broken) you will need a set of wire cutters (they look like plyers) Cut the entire wire off as close to the end as you can while still removeing the damaged section.  Cut the colored plastic about 1/4 inch from the end and remove only the plastic section (do not cut the wires too)  Take the bundle of copper wires and twist them clockwise.  Place the bundle of twisted wires between the appropriate screw and the metal plate behind the screw.  Tighten the screw.  Repeate for the remaining wires.#6 Install the new plate on the outside of the switch#7 Turn the power back on & enjoy your handy work!It sounds like a lot but it only takes about 10 minutes!Good luck and if in doubt have a friend watch you do it to help talk you through the steps.Please e-mail me if you need clearification! <SEP> How do I change a 3-way light switch out in a bathroom for a more updated look?

I've worked in a wheel manufacturing plant for over 2 years. They get the balance checked at the machining level. Then they get polished and powder coated. If a wheel is "unbalancable" it is not sent any farther through the process. I do not believe that a simple powder coat will throw off the balance of a wheel so much that it wouldn't be balancable after the fact. As stated in another answer, the tires have to be removed for the pc process, so it seems logical that they will get re-balanced when the pc process is complete. In the bay area, you can plan on it being expensive to pc any type of wheels. Call around, search the web, investigate prices on this before just shelling out big bucks!!!! In short...Powder Coating wheels will NOT affect your balance beyond drivability. Hope this helps you. Good luck!!! <SEP> how does powder coating affect wheel balance?

Some models have door hinges that are adjustable. If that is the case, I would try to readjust those two hinges so that the door opens and closes properly. If those hinges are welded!

See if you can lead the water that comes down the gutters and downspouts away from the foundation.

Depends on the router.  Some have a lock mechanism to lock the shaft and disable the power switch.  Some you have to use two wrenches.  In either case, you will need a box end wrench to loosen the collett that holds the bit.  As you are looking at the business end of the router, the collett needs to rotate counter-clockwise to loosen the bit.  If the bit is still stuck, you will need to get a pair of pliers to GENTLY pull the bit out of the chuck using as light a pressure as you can.  If you have soft jawed pliers, that would be perfect.  You don't want to squeeze the bit so hard, the carbide chips or cracks.  As you are pulling on the bit, keep the shaft in the locked position and pull and rotate gently.  If the bit is still stuck, remove the collett completely and use a flat bladed screw driver to gently pry apart the flutes in the chuck.  Be patient, be gentle.  You can also look on the Sears website for an owners manual for your specific router. <SEP> how do you change a bit out on a craftsman wood router? <EOS>
without seeing the job-but having done a lot of repairs in older houses-i can sympathise with your very real problem.the first being that the last home-owners either were unaware or were too cheap to do the job properly. there is only one solution that i would reccomend--hire a licenced & bonded plumber to inspect the project--walls will probably have to be opened so be prepaired to hire a carpenter to repair the finished job. this is not a job for your local handyman-if done improperly it may cost you a lot more in the future. ---- a TEMPORARY fix--- you can use dialectric fittings-threaded @ one end(galv. end)-sweat joint @ other(copper end). i cannot stress enough that this is a band-aid fix.DO THE JOB RIGHT and save future expense & headach.good luck <SEP> How do I replace galvanized pipes with copper pipes IF the original galvanized pipes are inside the walls?

Very good description! When there is only one cable in the switch box with a red wire then the black is hot and red is the switch leg(called one-upping) and white is the common/neutral. Hook the black and red to the switch and nut the whites together and close up. In the ceiling box The black wire feeds the switch so you tie it to a hot circuit(should already be done but will usually be black) and the red you tie to the hots of the ceiling fan black and blue and white to white and green to green. This is if there is only one switch in the wall! If there are two switches then its a little different. What has happened here with a single switch is that the fan allows for two but aren't necessary. The black wire is usually for the fan motor and the blue(slightly smaller) is for the lights(if there are no lights then don't wire the blue it's there for later light expansion.) <SEP> how do I connect a ceiling fan/light when the power feed is at the ceiling box?

First, to protect yourself from liability (not libel--that's different), hire a licensed contractor who is insured.  Ask for proof of both--he will be able to produce his current contractor's license and proof of up to date insurance and worker's comp.Second, take the time to read his contract.  If you can't understand it, spend a few dollars to have an attorney review it.Third, ask for references and call them.  It's important to understand that building and remodeling projects NEVER go as planned, so don't be surprised if all the references were disappointed in something.  But, you should focus questions on his overall character, not on the project itself.Finally, when you select a contractor, ask him some of these questions:How long do you think this project will take?What things could make it take longer?If it lasts longer, will that cost me more?Is there anything I can do to make it faster?What are some surprises you've had in the past on similar projects?How did you solve those?A good contractor will appreciate these questions, and will take the time to talk to you about them.  With this, you will have an understanding of what he's about to do, which will establish a good relationship with him.  That's just about the best protection you can get! <SEP> How do I protect myself while hiring a contractor.?

There should be a a "spring loaded" tension pulley on it somewhere. Follow the path of the belt until you find it. Once you locate it you should be able to put a socket or wrench on the pulley and pull it (not turn it) as you do you should see the tension on the belt release. Once it is loose enough slip the old belt off. The precess i the same to put it on except you need to have the new belt correctly around all the other pulleys and when you pull on the tension pulley it helps to have someone slip the belt on for you.Note: It will take a lot more pull to get the new belt on then it did to get the old one off. The old bet has stretched so you don't have to pull as far.Hope that helps... <SEP> how do you change a serpentine belt on a 1995 chevy cavalier w/air?

Be sure to till up the ground at least 6 weeks before planting season starts in your region. Then pick out what you want to grow. Be sure to pick an area of your yard that gets enough sunlight, or has shade for certain veggies. Tomatoes love sunlight, but quit growing at 96 degrees. Also, do not water tomatoes from above, they must be watered at the root. Corn must be planted in rows of two as they need to cross fertilize. Also, pick a really good fertilizer.

What sjaquay5708 the maintenance tech said is right on. You've got to find the source, first. He named the most common -- toilet fill valve and hot water pressure relief valve. There are more possibilities, too.Put on your Sherlock Holmes cap and be alert to what's happening the next time you hear the squeal. It can come from the startup or idle down of a motor. What runs regularly? Furnace, refrigerator, freezer. Pay attention to what else is happening close in time to the squeal.Smoke alarms, when the battery is dying, will put out a random sound usually described as a "chirp" but that might come out as a short squeal.Doors can squeal when opened or closed or moved by the wind.At one time, way back when, TVs had tubes. When a tube was going bad there would often be a 60-cycle squeal. Only about one in three people could hear it. This would usually happen when the TV was turned on or off. Nowadays I would doubt anything like this, but hey, who knows?Some devices have a low battery warning even when turned off, and what about a forgotten alarm? Is there a lost cell phone in the couch cushions or a clock radio buried under clothing?Be imaginative. Use your hearing, your eyes, and your sense of what is going on to help isolate the cause.

You may have two problems by the sound of it. First you need to check the seat safety switch because it sounds as if that isn't making contact with the bottom of the seat. When you try to shift it into gear the safety shuts the mower down because the safety thinks nobody is sitting on the mower. It's less likely that the linkage for the shifter is broken or just loose. While your under there take a look for a small box looking thing that should be placed by the NEUTRAL setting. The box is a safety device to make you place the transmission in neutral before you can start the mower. Sometimes you can unplug it and the mower will start but if it's a newer mower than it may be loose and just needs to be tightened up. If you find either one of those to be the problem, than go to your nearest auto parts store and get a tube of LOCK-TIGHT and coat the threads before you tighten everything up.

get a timing light, connect to battery and #1 cylinder.  find your timing marks on the pulleys at the bottom of the engine. mark with some white out, then with the engine running, aim the timing light at the mark and twist the distributor until they line up.  if this isn't working for you then you'r timing is waayyyy off and you need to set the base timingpull the valve cover, locate #1 cylinder, then rotate with a breaker bar on the end of the crankshaft pulley until your #1 cylinder is at top dead center (tdc).  then reinstall your distributor with the rotor pointing to the #1 point in the distributor cap.  re-assemble, leave the distributor loose enough you can twist it around and then fine tune the timing iwth the timing gunis this a newer car with fuel injection.  most don't allow you to adjust the timing.  what you do is set to a particular timing of say 0 or 10 before top dead center.  then as you drive, the engine computer takes over advancing and retarding the timing as necessary under driving conditionsif you're having trouble setting the timing it could be that the computer is trying to set it at the same time.  my ford has something called a "spout connector" which is just a jumper.  by disconnecting i disable the computer timing temporarily, allowing me to set the timing to 10btdc.  once that's done i plug the jumper back in, start the truck and the timing is now within range for the computer. <SEP> How do you set the timing on a Corsa 3 cylinder 1.0L? <EOS>

First go buy a submersible pump (sump pump) and hose to get the water out.  If you have a window in your basement you can put the hose thru the window.  Make sure to drain the water far enough away from your home so it does not just leak back down into the basement.  Next you should pull out anything that was submerged in water and discard it.  This includes carpeting, furniture, etc.  If there is drywall on the walls, you may be able to salvage most of it by cutting a line all the way around the room 12" above the waterline and reinstalling a new strip.  Once everything is cleared out, get some dryers and dehumidifiers down there and let them run for 3-4 days.  Longer if need be.  A few nice days will help too.  Open windows if you can, as moving air helps alot.  When you think its dry enough to move things back in test the slab by taping down some clear plastic (2'X2') in the middle of the concrete floor.  Leave it taped down overnight.  If there is any condensation on the inside of the plastic the next morning, you need to keep the blowers anddehumidifiers working longer.  You may rent the dehumidifiers at your local rental yards or Home Depot. Finally, you should deal with the reason your basement flooded to begin with.  Adequate rainwater leads usually help to prevent this.  You can also dig french drains around the foundation to drain away excess water before intrusion into the structure.  Type in "french drainange" on Yahoo search for more info.

I don't know if you attempted to turn the tap with your hands or with a pair of pliers...so you may want to consider using a tool...; also there should be a screw on the top of the tap knob (the top being the part that faces out towards you).

The tires themselves will fit on the rims of your new car. Without knowing what car they came off of, and what the new car is, I can not tell you if the rims will fit, or not. Try to put one of the tires on, and see if the bolt pattern is the same and the wheels fit. If they do, you are good to go! If not you will either have to have the snow tires mounted and balanced on the new car's rims, or you will need to get spare rims to mount the snow tires on.Going one size down is not going to be a big problem, your speedometer and odometer will be a bit off. Some vehicles with computer controls can be re-programed for different tire sizes, check with your mechanic or the dealer about this for your car. <SEP> How do I know if my old snow tires will fit on my new car?

Just cut the wire(Breaker off) Get a junction box and make up the three blacks 3 whites and three greens(or bare) wires.  Make sure you make the black to the brass screws and the white to the silver screws on the outlet.  Use the same size wire as the circuit you are cutting into.  You should really use a gfi repcepticle in the garage and bathrooms.  The wire may be on a  gfi breaker or off the line side of a gfi breaker.  Shut the circuit off and see if your gfi recepticle goes off and if you are on the line side(before) the gfi you should remove the gfi and put it in the garage and put the regular outlet where the gfi was then you would run the circuit from the breaker box to the load side of the gfi and the line side to the out going wire. <SEP> how do I add an electrical outlet to a "middle-of-the-run" existing outlet?

If you need to replace the existing roof mounted antenna aerial then all you need to do is unscrew the old aerial and screw in a new one.  If you need to replace the entire antenna including the base, then you need to remove the headliner, disconnect the antenna wire, remove the retaining bolt, remove the old base, and install a new base by reversing the order.If you need to install an antenna where one does not already exist, then you need to remove the headliner, drill a hole in your roof, install antenna base, install antenna wire (amplified) and connect antenna with head unit, and re-install headliner.hope this helps.

1)The sump pit must be below the water source and be about 24 - 48 inches deep.  2) the water must have a path to the sump pit - gravel and clay tiles.  3)The sump pit must be lined to keep material from entering the pump - use plastic sump pit liner sold at Lowes/Home depot or form and pour a concrete pit -it can be round or square -approximately 24 inches in diameter. 4)There must be a place for the pump to dispose of the water - simply pumping it outside next to a foundation will not work - it will drain back down into the area you are trying to protect. The sump must discharge into a pipe or hose that discharges well away from area protected. 5) the electric sump pump must be plugged into a GFCI circuit. 6) The pump should have a back flow preventer in the discharge pipe immediately at the pump to prevent the water in the discharge pipe from re-entering the pit when the pump cycle stops. Sump pumps are sold by horsepower - 1/4; 1/3; 1/2 etc.  The size of the pump is determined primarily by how high you are lifting the water and how fast you want to lift it. <SEP> how do i install a sump pump? <EOS>

An electric generator works just the opposite of an electric motor. Where a current applied to an electric motor spins a magnet inside a copper coil, a generator spins (via gas engine) the magnet inside the copper coil to produce a current. If you are having mechanical problems, you'd service it like any small engine. If the engine runs fine but it doesn't produce a current, then you know its the generator.

Likely... the gas is already off if you;ve extinguished the fire and removed the logs,etc.  You don't smell or hear gas do you?So the gas is off.  If you are wanting to turn it off further upstream, there may or may not be a valve for doing so somewhere in your basement along the wall where your fireplace is.  Look for the (usually) black gas supply pipe.I personally wouldn't bother to do this.  The valve that you use that is on your fireplace is sufficient.

Chisel the cement around the pipe down about 3 inches and about 4 inches around. Go to a place like Home Depot and by 1 1/4 coupling and a piece of pipe to the length you desire.

Am wondering why you replaced your battery and alternator in the first place. Need more details. Is your alarm a factory unit or aftermarket?

Buy a spline tool at Home Depot for about $2.00. Buy a roll of screen and a roll of the grey spline. Roll out the screen material over the frame first without cutting it.

What ever you do, don't listen to FT.  Nor do you use a jackhammer.  Talk about trying to gain free points.Anyway what Dodgeman says is correct for the most part.  Remove the lower caliper bolt, using a screwdriver, push the piston back a little bit and swing the caliper up.  Slide the caliper from the bracket that holds it.  Hang the caliper with a cord or something, do not allow it to hang freely as this can damage the brake hose.Remove the caliper bracket and then remove the rotor, may need to smack it with a hammer to remove it.I use a grinding disc to clean the hub so there is no rust.  This helps to eliminate the chance of causing a pulsation in the rotor.  I also use a wire brush to clean the caliper bracket where the pads slide and use brake grease from NAPA to lube them up to allow the pads to slide.  Now is also a good time to push the piston back into the caliper.To re-install, place the rotor on the hub and install the caliper bracket and tighten down.  Install the brake pads correctly (I usually put a small amount of silicone grease on the back of the pads to reduce squealing).  Install the caliper and tighten.  Install the tire, snug the lug nuts in a star pattern and torque evenly to 100 ft/lbs.MAKE SURE TO PUMP THE BRAKES UP BEFORE DRIVING AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY WORK!!! <SEP> How do I remove the rotors off of a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am?

If you are talking about searching, then @akira's question is correct. However, it sounds like you are asking about how to use this condition in a filter.  The trick is that you can put whatever search criteria you want in the filter's Has the words field. For any other field it will prefix your criteria with the field name. For example, if you type user@example.com in the To field, it'll create the filter condition to:(user@example.com) . The reason it works in the Has the words field, is because it doesn't prefix it with anything. This is because it acts as a normal search on the content of the email.   Create or modify a filter.  In the Has the words field, enter your OR condition. For example: to:user@example.com OR from:user@example.com   This is also the place to put any other attributes you want to match (e.g. label: , in: , etc.).  This will also work in the Show search options page, however it's easier to just use a normal search instead. <SEP> How to specify “OR” conditions for Gmail filter <EOS>
1. Get a pair of tweezers or an old small scissors in order to lift long hair out from the drain, or whatever may be causing the clog.  Try running hot water down the drain, and see if it goes down quickly.  If it is still too slow, and collecting in the tub, try putting a half-cup of baking soda in the drain, then pour a half-cup of vinegar immediately afterwards.  Then rinse with water.2. Another way to unclog a tub is to use chemical products such as Drano or LiquidPlumr.  Just don't use vinegar and then use the chemical product at the same time! 3.  Have you tried using a plunger?  This may also work.  Move the plunger in an up-and- down motion quickly, loosening the clog as you go. If everything didn't work, call a professional to snake the drain, and remove the entire clog from the drain. <SEP> How to unclog a tub? <EOS>

How big of an area got soaked?  This answer assumes a fairly large area (10x10 or larger)....Pull it up.  You need to dry the carpet padding too.  You need to rent carpet fans.   Most experts will tell you that if the padding is soaked through and through.... replace it with new or you risk mold and mildew.Place every fan you that can get your hands on to run air through the room and out a window.   Make sure you have another window across the house open for cross breeze.Bonus points for rolling in a dehumidifier too.

You probably should have put a piece of waxed paper over the hole and the cardboard on top of the waxed paper.  That way the waxed paper wouldn't stick to the plaster.  The usual method of repairing a hole in plaster board is to put a support piece behind the wallboard rather than try to get mud to hang in a hole that size and support it from the front.

Bearing preload is usuallu set by applying a set amount of torque to a bearing nut and relaesing a certain amount of the presure on the bearing.

"Bounce" This Along -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My mail carrier told me that the US Postal service sent out a message To all letter carriers to put a sheet of Bounce in their uniform pockets To keep yellow-jackets away. Use them all the time when playing baseball and soccer. I use it when I am working outside. It really works. The yellow jackets just veer around you. 1. All this time you've just been putting Bounce in the dryer! It will chase ants away when you lay a sheet near them. It also repels mice. 2. Spread sheets around foundation areas, or in trailers, or cars that are sitting and it keeps mice from entering your vehicle. 3. It takes the odor out of books and photo albums that don't get opened too often. 4. It repels mosquitoes. Tie a sheet of Bounce through a belt loop when outdoors during mosquito season. 5. Eliminate static electricity from your television (or computer) screen. 6. Since Bounce is designed to help eliminate static cling, wipe your television screen with a used sheet of Bounce to keep dust from resettling. 7. Dissolve soap scum from shower doors. Clean with a sheet of Bounce. 8. To freshen the air in your home - Place an individual sheet of Bounce in a drawer or hang in the closet. 9. Put Bounce sheet in vacuum cleaner. 10. Prevent thread from tangling. Run a threaded needle through a sheet of Bounce before beginning to sew. 11. Prevent musty suitcases. Place an individual sheet of Bounce inside empty luggage before storing. 12. To freshen the air in your car - Place a sheet of Bounce under the front seat. 13. Clean baked-on foods from a cooking pan. Put a sheet in a pan, fill with water, let sit overnight, and sponge clean. The anti-static agent apparently weakens the bond between the food and the pan. 14. Eliminate odors in wastebaskets. Place a sheet of Bounce at the bottom of the wastebasket. 15. Collect cat hair. Rubbing the area with a sheet of Bounce will magnetically attract all the loose hairs. 16. Eliminate static electricity from Venetian blinds. Wipe the blinds with a sheet of Bounce to prevent dust from resettling. 17. Wipe up sawdust from drilling or sand papering. A used sheet of Bounce will collect sawdust like a tack cloth. 18. Eliminate odors in dirty laundry. Place an individual sheet of Bounce at the bottom of a laundry bag or hamper. 19. Deodorize shoes or sneakers. Place a sheet of Bounce in your shoes or sneakers overnight. 20. Golfers put a Bounce sheet in their back pocket to keep the bees away. 21. Put a Bounce sheet in your sleeping bag and tent before folding and storing them. It will keep them smelling fresh. 22. Quick, bounce this on within the next 5 minutes!

Get a Hayne's Manual.  It's too detailed to try and post here, and besides, what good will it do you on the computer?  Grab a Chilton or Hayne's manual for your car and go that route.

Depending on the cause of the seize you have 2 options. First off if the threads are cross threaded from improper installationyou will have to replace the faucet.  Hopefully the cause of the seize is build up of rust, lime or calcium.  If this is the case try first soaking the end of the faucet with lemon juice in a cup for 30 min. to an hour. This should help break down the deposits.

my question is why would you even put latex paint over a powder coat. powder coating is used on metal engine parts wheels and vehicle frames. powder coating is used because its a thicker coating then regular paint because its stands up to pelting of road debri better then regular paint. but if you are going to paint it then just lightly scuff the paint with a 120 to 80 grit sandpaper. then paint the way your planning however i dont understand why your going to <SEP> How to apply laytex paint over powder coat? <EOS>

the easiest way to tell if a fuel pump is working or not is to have someone else turn the key to the on postion but not actually turn it, put your head down by the gas tank and listen when the other person turns the key to on you should hear a whining sound for a couple of seconds at most if you should get stuck somewhere and you can't hear the fuel pump start when you turn the key to on, you can try kicking the middle of the gas tank which generally where the fuel pump is . sometimes the pump will jiggle around enough to allow it to work again. caution should be used if you have a metal gas tank because if it's rusted you may put your foot through it if you kick it hard enough <SEP> How do you check to see if your fuel pump is broken on a 95 ford f-series truck? <EOS>

Before you begin make sure you have a leak! Spas lose a lot of water through evaporation. Fill the spa. Turn it off and let the water cool. Mark the water level. Leave it off 24 hours and mark the water level again. Measure the distance between the marks and record this measurement. Now, fill the spa to the original level and run- without heat- for 24 hours. Again, mark the water level and measure. Compare the measurements of "off" and "running". If they are close to being the same, you have no leak, as long as the water loss is negligable. Keep the cover on the spa throughout this process, as it will help to retard any evaporation. If there is a big difference in the measurements, then you have a leak. There are 3 possibilities:1). Spa loses more water running than off. That would be a return line (pressure) leak. Water is forced out under pressure when the pump is on.2). Spa loses more water off than running. Suction side leak. When the pump is on it will suck air in and slow down the amount of loss from water running out. Gravity flows out when the pump is off.3). Both water loss measurements are the same- running or off. That is structural. Leaking around a gasket or some such thing.Do the above and you will have eliminated 3 of 4 possibilities. Let me know which you have and I'll advise you further. Also need to know if the spa is fiberglass, concrete, etc.Hope this helps. We'll find the sucker! <SEP> how do I fix a slow leak in my spa?

You are dealing with a compression faucet. The valve opens and closes via a valve stem. That stem has splines on the end of it, underneath the handle. The handle has ridges in the backside hole that mate with the splines. If the handle is spinning around on the valve stem, what has happened is that the splines and or ridges have worn and do not mate properly. Since the usual reason that you cannot remove a handle after removing the screw beneath the index cap is corrosion between the mating surfaces of splines and ridges, I doubt this is your problem since the knob is spinning around the valve stem. Look on the side of the handle for some sort of set screw. These are fairly small and usually require an allen wrench to remove them. If there is none, try prying the knob off with a large flathead screwdriver under the handle. Place something such as a paint stir stick between screwdriver and any surface that may become damaged. If that doesn't work you could purchase a faucet handle puller for the job.Once you have the handle removed most likely you'll need to replace the valve stem. You will need to turn off the water to the valve. If the shower does not have shut offs somewhere nearby ( most likely it won't) and you are wanting to remove the hot water valve stem, you should be able to shut off the cold water supply to the hot water heater to avoid having to use the shut off for the entire house. By turning off the cold water supply located on the line coming into the hot water heater, you are in effect shutting off pressure to all hot water faucets in the house. Then untighten the packing nut that holds the valve stem in place. You should now be able to continue backing out the valve stem until it comes out of the seat. Take this to a hardware store and replace. Why did all this happen in the first place? The screw under the index cap became loose and allowed the handle to start grinding the splines off. Hope the info helps. <SEP> how to remove old shower knobs? I have an old house built in the 40's and the hot knob just spins and spins and won't completely turn off the water any more.

I finally figured out the Facebook search bar trick!! So for years there's been this rumor that the search bar is the key to finding out who views your FB. They say it's just a legend... Not really!! So legend has it that if you type in a letter, the first result is either the person you searched for/looked at last... Or if you never have, that person has looked at you! Or they search for you frequently, or both.  ( It also works based on interaction, for friends especially, but I have found this to work for friends who never interact with you, as well as friends of friends who have never had interaction.)  So I conducted a little experiment and found out that the trick does work - but ONLY IF YOU'RE BOTH SEARCHING  for each other! That's the missing link. I had someone view me... Nothing. They were still in position 4 down from the top. I search for someone else, who has not viewed me, and nothing - they're still a low result. But then I search for the person who viewed me on the same day, and boom! Less than 3 hours later, they were result number one when I typed in their first or last name initials!! Incidently, this works for friends, or friends of friends, even those who only have one mutual friend in common with you!  (Important: don't try to cheat by partially typing their name. First initial only, for first or last names! Also, this works for the full-site FB, which I use on my phone as a modification to the mobile FB. It does not work with the iPhone app.)  If you search for someone, friend or not, they will still show in your top 5 results for up to a day or so, then they rank lower and not even show in your top 3 if you don't search again. If you search for someone and they instantly (about 3 hours later) rank 1st after that, they've been searching for/looking at you too! If they eventually drop in ranking, either another one of your friends with the same initials interacted with you recently, or you're the only interested party...  Of course, this will be difficult to track if you're stalking them and click on them several times a day, LOL! But I've found that one single search is enough to set it off. ( I keep track of my searches by using the search log. Clearing your searches can throw off results after a couple of hours, too.) I've tried this experiment on multiple days... Same results. (In case you're wondering where I find the time, the answer is that I don't sleep a lot!) <SEP> How does Facebook guess results when you search for someone? <EOS>

Depends upon the amount of overspray and what type of paint it was in the first place.  Can you flake off the specks w/your fingernail?  If YES, then just take out an old credit card and start lightly scraping it off.  This works for caked on road tar on the rockerpanels behind your tires as well.  I'm not too sure I'd do the paint thinner or any other solvent unless its a last resort (repainting your car is expensive and loses you resale value).  You can afford to lightly scratch the clearcoat surface of your paint as you can buff it out later or have it done.  I would consider taking your car to a detailer or actual bodyshop.

I am attempting to install about 90 feet of french drains along the interior perimeter of my basement directing torwards a sump pump basin. I have already used a laser level to find the low spot (pump location) and have a pretty go idea about the layout of the system. The plan was to create an 8" wide ditch (8" to 10" deep) along the perimeter and fill with gravel and corrugated 4" drain pipe. There is a "cloth wrap" available that installs over the pipe to prevent dirt and debris from ever clogging the pipe perferations. Once the pitch is established the pipes will be directed into the sump pump basin. The sump basin is a standard "sump pump basin" from Lowes or Home Depot with a 1/2hp pump with float auto-activation.When everything is put into place, I will back-fill with more gravel and then patch trench with cement leaving a 1/2 inch gap along the wall for any water from the walls to drain in to.I need help on the proper tools and prep work as well as supplies to use. <EOS>

FIRST READ THIS ANSWER.DO NOT GO DIGGIN IN YOUR UNIT FOR FOOD OR ANYTHING.Under most units there is a alan screwWhen you get the unit installed they will give you a alan set wrench to unclog the unit.all you have to do is make sure the power is off and put the wrench in the bottom (its next to the reset) and turn it back and forth this will losein what is in the unit. If you cant turn it and its stuck really good then you need to get all the water out of the sink use a shop vac- then look inside to see what it is. and go from thereThe reason i say dont just put your hand in because Im a plumber and I have seen many people get cut really bad because a spoon or something got in the unit and they put there hand in to grab it and got cut. You have to remember there are a set of blades in the unit also They are n ot sharp per say but over time they could get that way.Also a good thing to have on hand Is a Garbage disposal wrench ( it looks like the letter T with a moon shape pc on the bottom. What this does You insert it into the top of the unit and it fits between the blades and you move it back and forth. Just like the wrench under the unit but this 1 is alot more easy to use. And you could get this at and hardware store for 10 bucks.1 Last thing if the unit is bad due to a spoon and it got ruined Go buy a ISE Unit at home depot they ahve about 6 differnt ones there you want to buy 1/2 horse it will set you back bout 100bucks. But the good thing about these units are they have auto reverse. What this means is when you turn the unit on it works normal but when you shut it off it spins in reverse (this is done to reduce the risk of a jam in the unit) and also ISE is the best out there for home use. And I hate to say this but if you have a GD like a bone crusher or anything like that THEY ARE NOT WORTH 5 Bucks. They might seem to work but they do not chop the food into very small pc they are alot bigger, And this in time will cause the line to get cloged And you dont need that. <SEP> How can I fix my garbage disposal?

Jack is right about trying the plunger first although I'd suggest using two plungers, one for the drain and one to go over the overflow (above the drain, below the faucet), if you don't block the overflow while plunging the drain, you'll just be giving the force of the plunge a way to escape and not affect the clog.If you end up using a snake, remove the overflow cap and rod it from there, not the drain. The pipe bends are not as sharp going in from the overflow, which makes it a lot easier.On a side note, it's not a bad idea to put some Drano down the tub drain once a month to help prevent build up and slow draining, especially in an older building. A drain strainer helps too. Catch the hair before it has a chance to clog. <SEP> How do I un-clog my tub? <EOS>
Mr. plevine, you first have to determine whether your system uses R-12 or R134a before servicing or troubleshooting it. How do you know whether the system in your vehicle uses R-12 or R-134a? LOOK FOR SPECIAL INDENRIFICATION DECALS OR LABELS ON THE MAJOR COMPONENTS.What else should you look for? The high-side low-side service fittings on an R-134a system are completely different from those used on an R-12 system.On an R-12 system, the high-side service fitting is a 3/8-inch 24 for screw-on couplers; the low-side fitting is a 7/16inch 20 (also known as 1/4-inch flare fitting) On an R-134a system, the high-side and low-seide service fittings are special 1/2-inch Acme-type fittings with no external threads. They have internal threads, but they're for the specially-designed caps unique to R134a fittings. Mr. plevine look for a RED-CAP for high-side BLUE-CAP for the low-side.

[taken verbatim from ehow]For more info and many tips from people with the same problem.. follow the link at the source. I hope it helps!1.   Use the toilet as little as possible once you notice there's a problem. This will help prevent overflow and water damage.    2.   Insert a plunger into the toilet, making sure the rubber globe or cup is fully seated over the drain opening.    3.   Push down on the plunger handle with firm but careful strokes. Rough, careless use can damage the toilet bowl. If the clog isn't too tight, these bursts of increased water pressure will probably clear the obstruction.    4.   Attack tougher problems with a snake (see "eHow to Use a Plumber's Snake').    5.   Consider a drain cleaner only as a last resort. Make sure that any product used is specifically marked as safe for use with porcelain, and follow the manufacturer's directions carefully. Never mix any of these chemical agents, as dangerous reactions could occur.    6.   Flush the toilet several times to remove the drain cleaner and to check the flow. <SEP> how to unclog a toilet? <EOS>
Certainly you have boiled water in a teapot, a boiler is much the same.First it has a fuel/heat source which in your case is gas.The boiler has electrionics that open the gas valve to allow gas to the burners for a period of time.  During that short period of time there is a ignitor that sparks and lights the gas much like on your stove.  When the temperature in the house matches what the thermostat is set at the gas shuts off. (no real need to worry about the gas blowing up your house)Back to the teapot, you have put water in the teapot, there is water in your boiler, normally this water level is controled by a float which turns on the water when the level gets low and shuts off when the water gets to a normal level.If the water is too low the boiler will not start up as a safety feature to keep the boiler from burning up, like the teapot would do if you put it on the stove without water.After the water in the boiler starts boiling and getting hotter it creates steam.  You see this steam in your teapot coming out the spout.This steam is sent throught a series of pipes to the heaters throughout the house.  These heaters are normally cast iron and heavy, the steam enters the top of these heaters and cools back down to water which a pipe at the bottom of the heater sends the water back into the boiler, so normally unless you have valve packing leaking or joints leaking you need very little make-up water from your well or city.An additional note, this is a fairly quiet system, the only way sometimes to tell it is on is feeling the heater.In the Spring or Summer when the boiler is off and cool, drian the boiler and refill a couple of times to get the sludge out of the bottom to increase the effiency of it. <SEP> How does the 'boiler' work to heat the house? I have the timer set to come on 3  times a day. Is the gas supposed to come on in between these times? (I dont wanna make the house explode!) I have never seen a boiler before I came to England.

check all the fluids. the coolant should be a mid dark to mid light green, with almost a sweet odor to it. check the oil and tranni fluid. the older the fluid, the thicker it gets. for the winter time, a thinner weight oil is usually reccommended because oil thickens up at lower temps and it takes a longer time to oil the engine. a lighter oil means better start up protectionbeefy tires are needed unless you have all season tires. tire pressure should be checked at least twice a month. also, make sure to check if your heater works. <SEP> How should you prepare your car for winter? <EOS>
If you open the fridge door and look at the hinges you should see that a part of them is screwed to the door, also - along the top of the fridge door there might be a couple of screws holding the fridge door against a bracket fixed on the outside door!?If you unscrew all of these the outside door should come away from the fridge door (they might also be screwed at the very bottom - underside of the fridge door).this is the set-up we have on ours - hope it helps... <SEP> How do I take off the cabinet door on a fitted fridge?

if your car isn't running right and you think that it is the fuel injections system, I would try to buy some fuel injector cleaner before taking it anywhere.  I like the Lucas brand and it is only about $5 a bottle.  All you have to do is pour it into your gas tank (when the vehicle has around or less that 1/4 a tank), then fill up your vehicle with gas and don't fill it up again until you most of the tank of gas that you treated.  You need to pour it in before filling up so that it will mix properly.  Hopefully the injectors are just a little dirty.  If that doesn't work then I would take it to a mechanic unless you have experience in working on vehicles. <SEP> how do you know when ur fuel injector is getting bad or is bad? <EOS>
you have to take the cover of the front that hides everything-4 bolts,before you take your old oil filter of, put a regular piece of paper over the cross member so the oil runs off the paper and doesn't pool on your cross member (trick I learned form my buddy-a toyota mechanic, then its the same as everything else, drain, fill start, the only thing that i like to do when changing oil is I fill the new filter to the top and while the old oil is draining the new filter sits there and soaks up oil so its got 1&#92;2 to1&#92;4 full, the only time you cant do that is when you have a bad angle, like a mazda rx7 its staight up and down <SEP> how do i change oil in a 1999 Toyota 4runner? <EOS>

Use a good utility knife to cut a square around the hole.  Make sure you cut all the way to the studs of the wall. Also you need to cut, NOT PAST YOUR STUD, which is One inch and a half, but you need to cut your drywall past the begining of the stud half of that which is 3/4 of an inch on both sides.   Keep your cuts as straight as possible to make a good square.  Find yourself a peice of drywall big enough to fill in the square you just made.  Place it in.  Nail or screw the peice to the studs you exposed.  Tape it, mud it, sand it, and paint over it. <SEP> HOw do you fix a large hole in drywall? <EOS>
Actually, one gallon will not do much for your well.What you do, is add a gallon to your well, and wait 15 minutes.  Run your pump, until you take out all the water in your water holding tank, and replace it with the water in the well.Take a regular chlorine testing kit for a pool, and test your water, to see if it has any residual of chlorine.If you dont have any, then put another gallon down the well, and repeat this process...When you have a 1.0 mg/l residual after 15 minutes, then run your water holding tank out again, and test after 30 minutes.  (Also, open all the spigots in the house, and let the chlorinated water flow out of each of them, so that the chlorine will kill any bacteria in there as well.I estimate you will probably use 3-5 or more gallon or chlorine for your well, maybe more, maybe less, it depends on how much water you have in the well.Now, if you have a reading of 2.5 mg/l or less, IT IS SAFE TO DRINK!!My City, the City of Steubenville, Ohio, keeps a 2.5 mg/. residual of chlorine in our city water at ALL TIMES!!  (Aint it something, that 2.0 mg/l will kill fish, but we have more chlorine in our water than that!! :)...So, do not be alarmed if you do end up with a high cl2 (chlorox or chlorine) reading.Like I say, I would run it through all the lines in your house, and those outside your house, to kill all bacteria in the lines also.Also, chlorox only has 4% of chlorine by volume so, it acuatlly isnt that powerful as the two ton cylinders I was used to moving around that was straight chlorine! And that we use for the Water Filtration Plant--> Water Treatment Plant.How do I know this?I am a Ohio Class III Waste Water Plant Operator with 27 years experience, and I recently retired from the City of Steubenville.

You'll need to obtain your faucets model#.  Most home stores(Home Depot, Lowe's, Menard's, etc.) will carry replacement valve parts for your faucet.  The best bet is to return the the place of purchase for the parts.  First start by turning the water supply off to your faucet.  Then remove the handle or handles.  If it's one handle there's usually a set screw on the back of the handle.  This will gain you access to the nuts that hold the valves in place.  Remove the valves and inspect, they may just need washers or o-rings.  If so it's an easy fix, if not just replace the whole valve cartridge if available.  If you can't find parts for your faucet then you may have to call a proffessional, he can order the parts you need.  Check out the link below, it has plenty of pictures and instructions.  Hope this helps.  Good luck. <SEP> how to fix moen mitchen faucet? <EOS>
