The system is, or should be, self-regulating with regard to pressure and water supply.  I don't think you can affect this.  regardless of pressure, the system will circulate heated water by gravity and convection.  There should be a circulator that forces the hot water through the system and returns the cooled water to the heater.  If your system is that old, it could need flushing-something a heater tech should be called for- or the pipes might simply be clogged with corrosion or mineral deposits which would restrict the flow of water.  The "dripping" noises might be from expansion and contraction of the the pipes as hot or cold water is introduced.  What is your intent with regard to water pressure? <SEP> How do i raise and lower the pressure in my hot water base board heating boiler's pipes? I have a 1983 Boiler in my house.  I tried bleeding the air from the system a few days ago.  I did so till water came out and now i think it makes more water dripping noise in the pipes than before?  I want to bleed more from the pipes but i'm not sure if i should add more water and if that will increase or decrees the water pressure to much.  Right now the water pressure is at 23 psi and when it's on it's about 30 psi <EOS>

Obtain a new one from your dealer or other trusted source.  I believe the MAF is located next to your airbox on the right side of the engine, you'll see it clipped in just before where the intake connects to the airbox.  Just remove it, rewire and replace.  Although for a car like the S80 I would suggest that you take it to a dealer.  I just had mine replaced because the check engine light came on.  I also had to replace the two 02 sensors.

If you have a basement, or a crawl-space, you can drill screws from underneath (being careful not to use too long of a screw) through your subfloor to prevent the floorboard from moving.  This is a good cure, but, should only be used as a last resort because things can go wrong in a hurry if not done right.  Make sure you can determine how thick the plywood/subfloor under your hardwood is, and the hardwood itself, and use a considerably shorter screw then the total thickness.  You do NOT have to go into the hardwood, simply up to it so it does not move anymore.  You may have to use several screws for each spot. Have somebody up above making it squeak, it makes it alot easier to find and fix the spots.  Hope this helps, it's worked for me.  Good luck. <SEP> how do you repair sweaky wooden floors? i have hard wood floors that sweak througout the house, is thier something i can do to stop it without removing the entire floor. <EOS>
The Others answers do contain some good advice.1. Unless you like fighting a continuous battle, you need to correct the cause of the damp wall. [inspect the plumbing inside for leaks ( in some areas of the country copper pipes erode from the chemistry of the water), look at the gutters, possible high ground-water, poor surface drainage outside the house (which is what I'd bet on) , or more remotely a broken water line outside]2. Bleach will kill an active fungus, but bleach evaporates and does not offer a long lasting deterrent.3. Positive Air circulation will discourage mold and fungus, will aid in drying the wall, but may be tough for some basements, and fresh air is just not practical in the colder months.4. DO NOT PAINT the wall until you have solved the moisture problem. The paint will not adhere for very long to any surface that is continuously or periodically wet.5. Dehumidification is the most common solution, but a dehumidifier is nothing more than an air conditioner with all the parts running inside. It consumes energy, and is not a good long term solution. You will always have to remember to empty the water [unless you have a pump instsalled to run the water to the utility sink or outside as some AC systems have].6. A safe chemical that will kill and prevent mold and fungus, (besides killing chewing insects such as termites) is Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate (NA2 B8 O13 - 4H20).  It comes in a powder form, and has no noxious fumes, but is not recommended for applications where there is running water (situations that would wash the material away). This material will not evaporate, or deteriorate. One supplier is Nisus Corp., their product is called Timbor.--- All long term solutions point to solving the water problem --- <SEP> How to prevent fungus growing on a damp wall? <EOS>

Cast_Chris, I'm not sure which type of door you have.  If the screen you have came with your door then you might have the type that has plastic inserts that run up the sides and across the top and bottom.  Look at the door from the inside, it may look as part of the trim but, you should be able to get a flat screwdriver in between the edge of the door's window frame and a tiny lip on the plastic strip.  Twist the screwdriver and it should start to pop loose, then you can pull the strip out.  Repeat on all sides.  Pull out the glass then replace it with the screen panel.  Then put back the strips, they should pop back into place with a little effort.  All this is of course if you have that type of door.  If not sorry for all the extra reading.  Hope this helps.

Okay.  First of all you say that the building is "square".  If you are meaning that the roof is perfectly square than you've got the a true peaked hip roof. For this type of roof all you need is the hip measurement.  The mathmatics are considered rise over run.  Rise being the height of your roof and run being 1/2 the width of your roof.  First thing first.  You'll have to decide on a pitch (angle)you want your roof to be. Nprthern homes typically have steeper roofs due to snow loads while southern roofs typically have lower pitches due to higher wind loads.  Once you have your pitch decided, we'll use a 6" over 12" pitch in our example.  If you know that your building is 12 feet wide then 1/2 of that is 6 feet.  This is considered our run.  We will now simple multiply our run (6') by our desired pitch (which just happens to be 6. 6 x 6= 36" or 3 feet.  What this all boils down to is that for every 1 foot of our run our pitch moves up 6 inches.  Next step is using yet more math to discover our lenght of rafters needed.  The pythagiam (excuse the spelling) is the math we will be using.  It's simply wrote as a2 x b2 = c2.  We know what "a" and "b" are.  A=36" and B=6'or 72". Multiply 36 x 36 and you will get 1296.  Multi 72 x 72 and you get 5187.  Add 1296 and 5184 and you get 6480.  Now let's find the square root of 6480 (Good time for a calculator). 80.49 inches.  Roughly thats 80 and 1/2 inches.  This is our rafter length for a common rafter.  For the hips will use the same equations except we will multiply our same run by the number 17 instead of 12.  Additionally the pitch for the hip will be considered 6 over 17.  which means 6 inches of rise for every 17 inches of run.  If this is all to complicated go to Lowes and buy a speed square that comes with a rafter book.  The book will tell you how to measure for your rafters and the speed square will show you the proper angle.Good Luck!!!! <SEP> how do i set out a traditional hip roof? i need to know thw basics of setting out a traditional hipped roof with a hip on each corner of a square building <EOS>
Well Im a Plumber and you have a problem.Lets start with the water 1st Check near the unit in the bathroom there should be a valve at every unit. But this is not always the case. If not go to your basement or where the main unit is and look for the shut off there. The only thing is Most of the valves have not been turned off in 30yrs and they dont close all the way or they close but wont open again. Now for the pipe. Well No easy way to say this It needs to be replaced.There are lil fixes you can try They have lil clamps with rubber on the inside of the clamp you put it over the pipe and tighten up. But no matter what you do this is only a quick fix. The problem with solder is it dont work with water and also if the pipe is bad there is a 95% chance that the whole pc is bad. This is not a easy thing to fix though.I would suggest to call A Plumber not just anyone Call someone that works on these kind of units. I have seen some really bad jobs by plumbers that think they can fix anything that moves water and made it 10times worse.

Lets not run to re-wire so fast.  A grounded system is a great idea.

buy a diamond tipped spade bit for the size hole u need. you will need to dip your bit into some spirits of turpentine ( can get at hardware store). this keeps the bit cool as it cuts. keep doing this each time you start to see grit forming. as you drill, don't push on the glass, just let the weight of the drill do most of the work. u can hold it snuggly to the glass, but don't push. as you work the bit into the glass, rotate it. any time you see white dust forming, your bit is getting too hot and you're about to break the glass. for bigger holes you won't need a spade bit. u can check out the products online at crlaurence <SEP> How do you drill a hole into glass without it breaking?

You dont need an air conditioner for the attic. If you go to HD or Lowes you can get an attic fan which costs $90 and would be much cheaper to run.  Putting an air conditioner in the attic would cause problems any way. Central air does not get directed into the attic, just the house, so that wont help your situation. Also dont forget if you air condition the attic then you are looking at some major moisture problems in the summer which is probably what you are trying to avoid.

What are the symptoms?  You might just need to clean your bulb sockets.  It also depends on whether you have brake lights that operate as turn signals also or if it has completely separate turn signals.  You could just have bad bulbs.  I've seen all the bulbs go bad before anyone noticed!Some common symptoms on systems with brake and turn signals on the same bulbs:Tail light works OK but goes out when brakes are applied. Tail light will blink dimly when turn signal is used.This is a bad ground.  It could be a dirty bulb socket, or a loose ground wire.  The socket can be cleaned with a piece of sandpaper.  The ground wire will be located near the taillight assembly, bolted to the body.This system also runs the turn signals and brake lights through the turn signal switch.  A bad turn signal switch can mess up the brake lights and the turn signals.  The systems that use a separate brake light system have entirely separate circuits for brake, tail, and turn.  These systems typically have amber turn signals and red brake lights.The dirty socket or bad ground stuff still applies.If none of the lights work you probably have a wiring harness that has been damaged. <SEP> how do i fix the rear passengers tailight panel to make my tailights and brake light work? <EOS>
ok there are only a few things that can cause this1st the sink can be clogged if this is the case rent a snake and run the line if you want to hire someone to do this it will run about 61 bucks for a KS line2nd To me it sounds like a vent problemThe reason for a vent is when the water is draining down the line air comes down the vent pipe behind the water to make it flow faster and to make sure it makes it too the main line. If the vent is blocked you will get a popping noise or a gur-gul sound from the drain.If there is no Vent on the line you can always install a In-Line vent or a Studer vent.To check the vent you could get on the roof with a gallon of water and pour in down the vent and listen for the flow of water if it sounds good and clear then the line has a clog or a belly in the line.Most KS Lines have alot of grease in the line and It builds up Like little mountians in the line so when the water drains it goes up and down up and down and it could make a noise like water hitting a small dam in the line. so only 2 things it could be1 Clog or small clog2 Vent Problem <SEP> How to stop a noisy drain from kitchen sink?.

If you are talking about the water line that feeds the refrigerator, I wouldn't suggest changing it to copper, simply because the plastic hose is more flexible and won't crack if bent in the same place repeatedly.If you are set on making the change, make sure that you can do so without pinching or kinking the copper line (this includes when you push your fridge back into place).  The copper fittings are similar to the plastic, as both plastic and copper line make use of compression type fittings.  Make sure to get the same size pipe as the old hose with the proper fittings.  You can get these by asking for assistance at most hardware stores.  You will need a reaming tool to make sure the copper pipe flares at the end and is smooth.  This may also be obtained at most hardware stores.  Then cut to the pipe to the proper length, make sure you have smoothed and flared both ends of your pipe, connect the pipe to the valve and the refrigerator, and make sure to tighten both fittings properly.Not very hard.  Make sure to watch your fittings for a while to make sure you don't have any leaks before pushing your fridge back in place.If you are referring to a different pipe then I would also say "good luck!" <SEP> how do I change the ice maker copper pipe in a refrigerator?

Over 20 years experience.www.lowratesappliancerepair.comHOW TO CLEAN AND REPAIR A KITCHEN RANGE HOOD:A range hood that doesn't adequately remove smoke and smells from your kitchen is usually suffering from one of a few common problems: The grease filter or some part of the exhaust ductwork may be clogged, or the fan may be bad. Neither of these repairs should take you much time.Overall Things You'll Need:Plumber's Snake Ammonia Soap Replacement Fan Screwdriver, or nut driver and socket Old Toothbrush Heavy Rag Plastic Pan Unclogging the exhaust system:Instructions: STEP 1: Remove the grease filter by sliding it out of its clips.STEP 2: Submerge the filter in a plastic pan filled with hot, soapy water and 1/2 cup (4 fl oz/125 ml) ammonia. Let it soak for at least 15 minutes. If it's still dirty, soak it again, then rinse it thoroughly and set it aside to dry.STEP 3: Remove the exhaust fan. Unplug the fan, then use a screwdriver or a nut driver and socket to take out the screws that attach it to the hood.STEP 4: Clean the fan blades with an old toothbrush dipped into the ammonia-water mixture (see Warning).STEP 5: Clean the inside of the exhaust ductwork, using a plumber's snake with a heavy rag tied around the end. Push the snake through the ductwork. Soak the rag in the ammonia and water mixture, then run it through the ductwork. Rinse out the rag and repeat the operation until the duct appears to be clean.STEP 6: Clean the exhaust hood that's attached to the outside of your house. Use the old toothbrush and the ammonia-water mixture to loosen the grit and grime around the flapper plate. Make sure the plate moves freely when you're done. If it sticks closed, it can prevent the exhaust hood from working.STEP 7: Reinstall the grease filter. REPLACING THE FAN MOTOR:Instructions: STEP 1: Remove the grease filter by sliding it out of its clips.STEP 2: Turn on the fan and inspect the motor. It needs to be replaced if it hums rather than turns, turns very slowly, runs for a short time then stalls, or feels very hot and won't turn.STEP 3: Disconnect and remove the fan, following step 3, above.STEP 4: Take the fan to an appliance store to get an exact replacement.STEP 5: Install the new fan. OVERALL TIPS AND WARNINGS:Never put a grease filter in your dishwasher to clean it. You could end up with a film of hard-to-remove grease on the dishwasher walls. Clean your grease filter monthly. It's your first line of defense against grease and grime that can damage the fan motor and plug the ductwork. When cleaning the blades on the exhaust fan, take care not to wet the motor. The water could short-circuit the motor when you reinstall it. <SEP> How do you find/install a replacement over-stove kitchen exhaust fan? Are is making funny noises and dying.

What to do about ants without using poison?We Should not Poison Ourselves, Kids and PetsIt's a good idea to let ants know that yours is not their house, without killing them. For ants are very helpful to keep this earth clean. Using poison, we only poison ourselves, too, even when we do not realize it. Yet, a toxic effect can be seen immediately on life energy photographs after the use of poisons.Different PreferencesIn my experience, it depends on the type of ants what they like least.What can be Used?I have used cinnamon, peppermint, cayenne or citrus oils. Ants have a very sensitive sense of smell, and these items are too strong for them so that they avoid these. For some reason, some ants do not like cucumber rinds, grated and sprinkled around.Someone CheckingWith natural means we may not hinder all ants to come in, but most. They may be always a few ants just checking out our facility. If there is nothing they need, they do not call their armies to carry off the booty.Ants as Our EducatorsHelping us clean, the ants assist us to be very clean if we do not want their help. At least, they themselves do not poison us.Discourage Them Inside, but Give the Ants What They NeedWhat worked best for me is to distribute some of the above mentioned items around and in the house, and give the ants what they need outside the house.Knowing the WeatherBefore the rain they need oils and may find them when stove or floor are not cleaned. The ants know when the rain storm is coming before the weather man may know it. I have watched this for many years. They suddenly come in, in greater numbers, looking for oil, even on the pillow sheets, if they do not find it outside the house! The oil is needed to make their chambers waterproof! Especially in dry years they do not find enough sap of trees to meet their needs, and they enter the grease spotted house to meet their needs.Give Them What They Need - OutsideWhen the ants come in, in greater numbers, I know that a rain storm will come, although the sun is shining and no real cloud is in the sky. Then I place sheets of paper towel, soaked in olive oil, outside by the house, but a few yards away. This way the ants can smell the oil on their way to the house but are not attracted to the house directly. I hold the oiled pieces of paper towel down with some rocks. This way the ants can easily get the oil and walk off happily, leaving the house alone. One or two may still come in, but that's no problem. They are just checking.Ants like Seeds and StarchSprinkling sunflower seeds around also helps to keep the ants busy. A bag of bird seeds may be $4 and lasts a long time. It takes the ants some effort to carry off one seed, although the birds may gladly help to eat the seeds.The Queen KnowsOften, I wondered how the ants know what's in the house, where the sources are and when. Science found out that they have a psychic queen, who intuitively knows where the needed resources can be found. Amazing. Even when the ant queen was away from the ant home, she could still send her telepathic messages to the ants.Ants - the Garbage CrewImagine we had no ants on earth, ants who chew up the empty beetle shells. We would be swamped with these beetle shells, for they do not decay easily. The ants, like other animals in their own ways, take care of many other things for us, so that the earth stays clean.Let Them LiveFor that reason alone I think we need to be kind to the ants and tell them in a gentle way that we don't want them in the house, but let them live outside!A Stone Setting for the AntsI never had a major problem with ants as long as I gave them outside what they needed. A small stone setting may be sufficient to place some fruit scraps, bread crumbs, seeds, sugar items etc. out for them. They will be so busy, carrying these items off.

The EGR Valve Location is typically housed on the intake manifold (the very top of the engine)( I think it is on the drivers side next to the throttle body)   It's purpose is to recirculate a portion of the exhaust gas back into the intake manifold so it has to be connected to the intake manifold.  It is a round diaphram, will typically have a Vacuum hose connected to it, and typically held on by two bolts.

You have a vacuum leak somewhere - the computer is using the idle air control motor to try and compensate for that leak.  Check for cracked or disconnected vacuum lines or air intake hoses.  If you don't find anything, you can CAREFULLY spray small amounts of carburetor cleaner on and around the intake and vacuum hoses - when you hit the leak with the carb cleaner the idle will smooth out - be CAREFUL doing this - spraying it on a hot exhaust can cause a fire - carb cleaner is flammable - that's why the idle will smooth out - it's using the carb cleaner for fuel.It is remotely possible the idle air control motor is clogged with carbon or bad, but usually it's a vacuum leak.

Both of the previous are correct about applying heat to loosen the adhesive, but I personally prefer the use of denatured alcohol to remove any remaining adhesive.

Well in general for disc brake cars, you need to jack the car upsupport with jack standsremove the front wheelsfind the bolts holding the calipur onremove those bolts, and the calipur should slide back off teh rotor (the big metal disc)Then remove the old pads, adn put the new ones in adn reverse the order.BE SURE NO ONE PUSHES THE BRAKES WHEN THE CALIPUR IS OFF.this is overly simplified, but with some mechanical know how, it should not be too hard to figure out from here. <SEP> How to replace dodge durango front brake pad? <EOS>

If you still have the user manual for your car, it will have specific instructions.  However, here are some general guidelines:Take the hubcap off the flast tire, and use the lug wrench to loosen the lugnuts.  The lugwrench should be near the spare tire, and may even double as the handle of the jack.Once you've loosened the lugnuts, place the jack under the frame of the car near the flat tire, and jack up the car.  You can stop when the flast tire is off the ground.Take off the lugnuts, and put them in the hubcap so you don't lose them.Pull the flat tire off the wheel.  You may have to jiggle it a little.Put the new tire or donut, making sure that it fits snugly.  Put the lugnuts back on, and tighten them.  Don't make them too tight, as someday you may need to take this tire off.Lower the jack, put it back in your trunk, and drive away.Don't throw out the flat tire, you may be able to get it fixed at a gas station for as little as $5. <SEP> how to change a tire? <EOS>
If the battery is showing fully charged from the charger but runs out quickly or does not charge at all, I would suspect a bad battery.  Take a multimeter and read voltage (Make sure the meter is set to DC!).  No matter the charge on the battery the voltage should remain the same... to check the charger, put the battery in series with the charger/meter( this time turn the meter to Ampere setting 10A max first - if you get nothing, then you can adjust to the mA setting) and you should get a corresponding reading to the manufactures specs.NiCd (Nickle Cadnium) and Li-Ion (Lithium Ion) have dissimilar characteristics on charging rituals...e.g.  NiCads like to be FULLY discharged before recharging - this lengthens the life of the battery while if you truly discharge a Li-Ion, you'll probably never be able to use it again.Also, schwinn products might be sold at walmart.  Or where ever you may purchase another battery save the receipt, and take the bad one back.good luck <SEP> how do i fix my schwinn scooter it says its charged and does not charge? <EOS>

It will give you better access to the bolts in the timing belt cover.5- remove timing belt cover. (6 10mm bolts)6- with the 21mm socket at the crank pulley give the engine two full turns and align all the timing marks (small arrows pointing downwards you'll find three markings, 2 in the valve cover above the cam gears, and one one the block above the crank) TIP: I like to give the engine the two full turns, verify that everything is fine and then give it an aprox. 1/4 turn more, until i feel there is no resistance in the cam gears, then mark with a chalk stick, makes it so much easier to put the new belt on.6- remove crank pulley8- loosen timing belt tensioner (14mm bolt, left pulley)that should cover everything, replacement is the inverse, should take you about 2 hours. <SEP> how do you replace a water pump in a 1996 kia sephia? <EOS>

Not real sure. But, most fuel pumps are electric and mounted inside the Fuel Tank. You can trance your fuel line to be sure. Jack up the rear of the car and put on Jack Stands so you can look. You are looking for where the fuel line (About 3/8 inch) enters the tank. Most likely you will need to Drain the tank if it full (Heavy). Should be maybe two metal straps holding it on, you will see the Bolts/Nuts to remove to drop the tank and have access to the fuel pump. Be sure this is your problem first, it not hard to do, just sounds hard. You can have someone turn on the key and open the Fill Cap and listen for the pump to run, if it runs and then shuts off it may be good. Check your Fuses and sometimes there a safety shut off that may have got accidentally trip and needs rest, it to keep fuel from pumping if you in a wreck. If, the fuses, Fuel shut-off safety are good and you not see a damaged wire then you ready to drop your tank and replace the fuel pump. Good Luck and be careful.

First,since you rent,there may be a clause in your rental agreement that does not allow for these appliances in your apartment.This can be solved by simply asking the landlord of the apartment complex.If this is the case,the point is mute.If this is not the case then have them do the work or have it done by an electrician. The reason I say this is that installing a 220V outlet for a dryer most likely involves more work than you want to do yourself....cutting into the wall,getting wire in the wall,wiring the outlet and the breaker panel,installing a dedicated breaker,repairing the wall,and don't forget the dryer has to be vented,etc..If you are allowed to have a dryer in the apartment,you might try finding a 110V portable unit that you can simply plug into an existing outlet.Hope this helps. <SEP> How do I hook up ap an electric dryer??

The first answer is terribly dangerous.

Properly sized and installed the output will be perfectly usable with no further conditioning required.If you are serious about backup generator power you will require a specialized transfer panel to isolate the home electrical system and prevent the generator from backfeeding the street, potentially with lethal results.

To bleed the clutch system on a toyo pickup is pretty easy. First thing you should do is suck all the old fluid out of the clutch master cylinder with a suction bulb. That way it doesnt have to leak slowly through the lines. Then fill the clutch master cylinder up completely with DOT 3 brake fluid. That is what Toyota uses. Go underneath the truck on the right hand side, look at where the engine joins to the tranny. The bellhousing as it is called, has a clutch slave cylinder mounted on it. It is a round cylinder with a rod coming out one end, and what appears to be a brake line attaching to the other end. Look closely on the end with the line, and you will find the bleeder screw. It is a 10mm. Use a 6 point wrench if you have it, if not, a good quality 12 point. You dont want to round the flats on the bleeder. It works like a brake caliper bleeder. Just loosen it a couple of rounds, and let the fluid start to drain out. If there is air in the system, it may take a minute to sart draining. Use a bucket to catch the fluid, and let it drain until the fluid coming out is clear and not bubbly. Make sure you keep an eye on the master cylinder up top as it is pretty small and will run out of fluid quickly. When the fluid is clear and not bubbly, retighten the bleeder screw, fill the master cylinder reservoir, and you are almost done. Some air tends to remain in the system inside the master cylinder, but if it does, you can remedy it easily. Just get in the vehicle, and start pumping the clutch. ALL the way to the floor, and ALL the way back up. It may take a while to work the air out, so if you have bad knees, find someone who needs to use a stairstepper. When the pedal feels nice and crisp, and your clutch starts disengaging around the middle of the pedal travel, check the fluid again, and you are done. Pretty easy. <SEP> how do i bleed the clutch on a toyota truck? <EOS>

something similar happend to me, i have a saab.  in the saab, it was in back of the radio cousel.  i don't know exactly how acura's radio display is, but look around on how to pull it out.  the code is usually printed on that internel radio box somewhere.  some dealerships will charge you about $40 to do this (because they are the only ones with the proper tools to take it out), however, i went to a saab dealer and they did it for me for free.  don't try to call the manufacturer either;  they can't give you the code for security purposes. <SEP> How can I get my stereo access code for free?

To elaberate on what was said. IF you do not have a crossmember or steering arm in the way, then you are more than likely catching on the Crankshaft (it comes down about 3 inches into the oil pan) - or you are catching on the oil pump pickup tube (it comes down almost 5 inchs into the oil pan)You MUST lift the motor high enough that the pan will come DOWN to clear these items - WARNING if you move the pickup tube on the oil pump / or bend it / you will NOT get oil when you re-start the car - that pickup tube sets just above the bottom of the oil pan - about 1/2 inches from the bottom.WARNING - if you do not watch what you are doing you will break the distributor on the fire wall, or break the exhaust from bending them, or break the transmission from the lift.a couple of pic's below showing how far the crank and oil pickup sticks out from the block <SEP> How do I remove a oil pan from a 1968 Impala (327ci)?

First off get a new plug. Spray a bit of WD40 into the plug hole and let sit for a while. That will or should breakdown what ever oil got into the piston area. Put fresh gasoline into the tank.

At the pool I work at, some well-meaning parent shoved a pressure washer into a closet and stored it on its side.  The engine is a Honda GC190, and it was stored with the starter/flywheel assembly facing down.  Inspection of the airfilter showed that it was covered in what appeared to be motor oil (from crankcase breather tube maybe?) and the engine wouldn't start, it would turn over, but not start.  There is still enough oil in the engine and fuel as well, plus the oil in and around the air filter also got all over the carburetor and choke plate, so that probably is a problem too.  If anyone knows what to do to get it up and running again, the help would be much appreciated. <EOS>
On older cars, there is a non rubber hose about 2.5" diameter that runs from the exhaust manifold up to the air filter housing snorkel.

Spiral balances are notorious for failing.  Read your warranty.  Many times window warranties are written in such a manner that the integrity of the glass is guaranteed for 10 years or more while the mechanical parts (ie: spiral balances) are only guaranteed for 1 year.  If they are still under warranty, your contractor should replace them.If the spiral balances are found to be out of warranty, all is not lost.  You should be able to easily figure out how to remove the defective balances.  Take tham to any glass shop and they will order replacements for you.  Some of the larger glass shops will often keep them in stock.  They should cost you under $10.00 each.  They are so cheap, you might want to purchase a couple of extras in the sizes you are most likely to need in the future.If you have a window or two that you rarely open, you may be able to swap out the balances with the window that you do use in order to get by for a while.Good luck with your repair. <SEP> how can I fix a window with a broken spiral tube balance?

If you live in a council or h/a house or receive benefits, pest control from your local council will come out for free. I'm not sure what they charge otherwise. When I had them there wasn't much of a body count to be honest and the guy from pest control said that's normal enough cos they take the poison back to their nest and they all die there. Are you sure they are still alive? I'd carry on putting the poison down cos they are taking it and it will eventually kill them. Traps are useful too. Or even get a cat or dog - tho that's a bit drastic if you don't want a pet! Good luck I know how horrible it is but they will die in the end. Carry on doing what you're doing. The poison works on a body weight for weight basis so if there are quite a few of them it will take a while to kill them all off. <SEP> How can i get rid of the mice in my house?

Muriatic Acid is not the best option due to the fact that it deteriates the concrete.  Kitty litter is a great alternative however follow up with  OXY CLEAN. this will help remove any further residue.

Sorry but acid it the wrong thing to use.   If there is a lot of oil build up use a strong putty knife or scrapper to scrape up the oil, which if it is old, will be more like black tar.  Place all of the oil reside in an old newspaper that you have unfolded nearby.   Then use lacquer thinner.  Lacquer thinner will not contain oils that are present in many solvents and it will dry quickly.   Use a liberal amount in a small area (approximately 1 square foot) and use an old rag to draw the oil out of the concrete.  Repeat these steps as necessary to totally remove all the oil.  With a clean hand, make sure that there isn’t any oil residue left.   After this, if you still have a stain, buy a good “driveway” cleaner that is designed for use with concrete that won’t damage or bleach out the concrete.  I have done this many times with excellent results.  Good luck.Dennis in Anaheim <SEP> How can power steering fluid be removed from a driveway?I Even tried acid and it didn't work..? <EOS>
If you have a Network Interface box, open it and make sure the connectors are plugged in.  If they're already plugged in and you still have no phone service in the house, follow the wiring into the house and look for a connector or wire junction. This will either have plug-in connectors or blade-type push-in connectors for the wires. Check to be sure that the connectors or wires are attached.One caution - if the jacks weren't professionally wired, there may be a short in one of them, causing all the jacks not to work.  You'll have to find a problem like that by the process of elimination.  Choose one jack and examine the wiring to it.  If it checks okay, disconnect all the jacks BUT that one, then test it. If it works, reconnect the other jacks one at a time until they stop working. The last one connected will be the bad one :) <SEP> How do you activate a phone jack?

Jene is correct – “If you can feel the scratch with your finger nail it is too deep to be buffed out” An alternative to a regular body shop is a mobile service called AERO-COLOURS.

Cut out (at a bevel) a rectangular piece of drywall at least an inch larger that the hole you're patching. Using the patch as a template, place it over the hole and trace. Cut out using the tracing as your guide at the same bevel as the patch. Insert a backer board with construction adhesive applied to the ends. Hold the backer board firmly in place and screw drywall screws through the drywall into the board, at least 1 inch away from the edge of the hole. Repeat if using two backer boards. Place the new piece of drywall in the hole and fasten it to the backer board(s) with screws. Smooth compound around the edges of the patch on the wall. Smooth it out and put drywall tape over all joints with the joint knife. At the end of each joint, press the edge of the knife blade in firmly and use as a straightedge to tear off the tape. Sand when dry.Using a wide joint knife, spread a smooth, thin layer of joint compound over the repaired area or over all joints of the new patch. Be sure to extend beyond the damaged part and feather the edges out to the surrounding wall. Wait at least 24 hours. The compound should be dry before you sand it. Use a fine- grade drywall sandpaper on a sanding block. Wear a dust mask when sanding. You may have to repeat both these steps to achieve the desired results. <SEP> how can I fix ahole in my kitchen ceiling (about the size of a tea plate) without renewing the entire ceiling? it happened when I noticed a leak from the ceiling which was located to the bath (the seal had deteriorated) this has now been fixed and it no longer leaks.

I broke my pull cord about 3 weeks ago and had to do it. Fortunately it was right at the end so I didn't even need a new cord. Actually, I once broke a cord halfway up and rather than replacing it simply attached the handle to what was left and never had a problem starting it.Depends on the model, but the advice in the post above is generally right. The cord on most mowers goes thru a small hole on the top or side of the engine cover, around a narrow spool inside of it, and is kept there with a single knot on the other end (inside) of the spool thru a small hole in it. Thus remove the engine cover and when removing the spool observe how the cord is attached on the inside (if there is any left). The new one should obviously be attached the same way. It will probably be evident how the cord is attached on the inside. Winding on the new cord is a trick. You'll note that (if you didn't ruin anything) how there is tension when you turn the spool a certain direction. You want to wind the cord on in such a way so that when it is pulled it feels the tension as when you turn it with your hand. May have to hold in place with a straight screwdriver to accomplish that when winding and placing the end of the cord up thru the hole. The purpose of that is simply so that it returns to the engine cover after you pull it so you can try again. As little tension as necessary to accomplish that makes starting the engine easier. Hard to explain without illustrations for your model.Not easy but definitely doable - and once you learn how you wont have a problem doing so again. <SEP> how do i restring my lawn mower? <EOS>
slave cylinder is a hydraulics term- in connection with automotive applications it is the cylinder that actuates the brake shoes in a Bendix type brake, or the caliper in a disc system- the way you phrased this question makes me wonder if perhaps you have a less than honest mechanic.

The dimming circuit for the mirror works on the principle of differential - i.e. if the light coming at the mirror from the rear of the car as detected by a sensor on the face of the mirror is significantly brighter then the light striking the back of the mirror as detected by a photo sensor on the backside of the mirror, the circuit energizs the electrochromic surfce in the mirror (or, on older models, activates a motor that physically tilts the mirror).A quick check - there should be a small hole in the face of the mirror, and a sensor on the rear - are they covered by hanging objects?Also - is the mirror dirty?

Oxygen sensors can be very stubborn. Assuming you know which one needs to be replaced and where it is located, here are a couple of tips:Oxygen sensors are usually easier to remove if the exhaust pipe is still hot. Try to do the job right after the car has been driven, just be careful not to burn yourself on the hot pipe.Before you try to remove it, give the threads a shot of penetrating oil, and let it soak for five to ten minutes. I find that PB Blaster, available at any parts store, really helps. Great stuff. <SEP> How do I replace oxygen sensors in a 1998 Chevy Malibu? <EOS>

Open your tank (water closet) top.Take the hose that goes into the long tube and clip it to the outside of that same tube.  Not only will the bowl level lower, you will use less water per flush. For real water savings - though may cause too little water per flush to rid bowl of a large bowel movement and require a second flush on occasion - take a ziplock bag, fill with water, place in the water closet out of the way of any moving parts.  Usually just to the left (or right) of the flush handle.  This causes an ongoing displacement of water  that is never used.  You save the ziplock full of water on every flush.  The later method alone will not lower the outer bowl level.  I just through that one in for conservation and cost savings.  Enjoy! <SEP> how can I do-it-myself to lower the water in the toilet bowl? My toilet is a gravity toilet without floatball. It is annoying that the water splashes up when you are using it. I just want the water level to lower down to the bottom of the bowl.

First unscrew the armrest, and anything else on the door panel that maybe screwed in. Becareful, if you unscrew the lower guide light, the whole light assembly will come out, just unplug it, you'll  be ok. Then Along the edges of the panel you'll find these plastic clips retaining the panel onto the door frame...you  will literallly have to pull ( preferably a scraper may work, they do make tools for this, they look like big forks)on the panel to "un clip" from the door... Don't worry if you break a clip or three, you can find them on the Help Product isle at Pep Boys. Now when you have unclipped the panel pull up to get the window guides off the door edge, pull away slowly. You will have the window switch you need to unplug so pull panel away slowly and look behind panel to see if there are any connections you need to unplug. Ok now the door should be eposed! Just peel back the plastic cover carefully (if careful enough it will be able to re-adhere to door) Sometimes some window motors are rivted in, you will have to drill them out! They do sell rivet gun kits to replace the rivets. Now once the rivets are removed the motor should come free, becareful there are lots of sharp edges.... I'm pretty sure you can handle it from here! Just becarful when you place the motor in that it is lined up well and the track is straight...ok good luck! <SEP> How to remove car door panel from '82 Buick Park Avenue?

You can throw on a new intake and some new pipes out the back.  Improved air flow in and out of the engine will always do the trick.  An aftermarket computer programmer will also take care of the fuel curve, but while it adds more horsepower, you will lose a mile or two per gallon.  They're incredibly easy to use anymore...they just plug into your diagnostic port, which is normally under the dashboard.  If you want even more, you can add a larger bore throttle body.  Again, this will require a bit more fuel so that the ngine doesn't lean out, but your programmer should take that into account and will take care of that.  You could go on forever with upgrades and aftermarket stuff, but they're typically the cheapest and best start.  Check out http://www.summitracing.com/.  you should get yourself one of their catalogs.  I'm almost positive they're free, and it's the best bathroom reading ever printed.

MeetingWizard meets criteria 1,2,4 and 5.  I think it meets criteria 3 "copy and paste list of email addresses".  An address book is maintained within the application.  Rather than tediously entering each address in the address book, go directly to "Create a meeting request".  Propose one or more dates and times.  On the next "Meeting Event Details" screen, paste your list of email addresses, one address per line or separate with a  comma, to a maximum of 50.  Select the "Add all new addresses to Address Book" box, to eliminate entering the addresses the next time.  I recently implemented this for a local community band.  Many of the musicians are not comfortable using computers, so the two click response without the need for a login was excellent.

Try to determine what function (tail light, radio, etc.) is affected.  Also try to determine which fuse is blown.  From both ends of the problem you may be able to identify if any special wire insulation color is involved.  This may permit a visual trace to find a problem, including charred wires.  Also check the owners manual (or a more complete manual that you may find at a large public library) to determine what loads share a given fuse or wiring connection.  Manuals often include complete wiring diagrams and sometimes troubleshooting tips.  One wire say to a tail light should lead to ground while the other wire (at its terminal near the light) should not be grounded with the switch off and the bulb removed.  You can use a voltmeter and an ohmmeter to check for faults if you know what you are looking for.  Good luck. <SEP> How do I find a short in my jeep wire? <EOS>

If you are hearing a siren sound instead of the horn honking, then you have an aftermarket alarm.  I'm guessing you don't have a key fob or you would have known you have an alarm, so it is possible that the previous owner installed an alarm and as most people do, lost the fobs and just never armed the alarm again.  When you changed the battery, it activated this aftermarket alarm.  Before I tell you ways to deactivate an aftermarket alarm, let me tell you about the factory alarm in your Cavalier.  Your Cavalier is equipped with the chevy passlock system.  In brief, there is an optical sensor in your ignition that recognizes the cut of your key to prevent theft.  There is an "Anti Theft" indicator light in your instrument cluster - this is why you think you have a factory alarm.  This light only indicates that you have the passlock system.There are a few ways to turn off an aftermarket alarm.  Without the key fob, all you can do is to put it into "valet mode" which is kind of like putting the system in hibernation.  First, disconnect your battery again, put the key in the ignition, turn the key forward to the on position (past the position where you can listen to the radio, and before all the way where your car would start cranking) and re-connect the battery.  If there is no siren, then turn the key forward and start the car.  Look for a red LED light somewhere on your dash to stay lit (not blinking).  It is now in valet mode and your car is as it was before you changed the battery before.  If this doesn't work,  some of the older aftermarket alarms can be disabled by turning the key to the on position and back to off and repeat for a total of three times. (with the battery connected) If both of those don't work you will need to find either a silver toggle switch or a small round black button - normally mounted somewhere under the dash around where your left foot would go.  Try to leave your finger on the button and turn the ignition forward to on, or with the ignition forward push the button (or flip the toggle switch).  As with the first method, you will know you have succeeded when the red LED stays on without blinking. Good luck.Once you have the car in valet mode, take the car to a stereo shop and have the alarm removed (unless you don't mind repeating the above whenever your battery dies or gets replaced).  Most shops will only charge you 1 hour labor to remove the alarm. <SEP> How do i Disable the factory Anti-theft system in my 99 cavalier.

Every outlet in the building needs to be opened up to allow the trapped air out of the lines.  Until you do this, it will continue to make the groaning noise.  Does it make a banging noise when you suddenly shut off the tap?  If it does, talk to a plumber type dude at Lowes, or a hardware store, and ask about a valve that stops this from happening.  You might install one of these valves, and it will resolve the problem.  I have seen some stranger things happen.  Mybe you could call ghost busters lol?  I hope this help you in some way.

Sometimes the water can have a lot of air in it and it will take on a brown tint.  Try this; run some water into a clear glass, and let it set for an hour or two, and see if the water clears up.  Also; put some in a white tea cup, and let it set for an hour.  If its mud in the water the cup will have brown tint on the white glass that you can wipe off with a paper towel.  Usually when there is one there is the other.  If the clear glass of water gets clear after a while, then it may be air instead of dirt.  You can also run some through a coffee filter, and see what it looks like.  It can take some time for it to go away if it is that much air in the system.  Ask your neighbors if they are having the same kind of problem.  I'll bet they are.Good Luck!!! <SEP> How do I stop my bathroom pipes from making a loud trembling sound? It started when I was using the sink in my batroom to wash my hands. I couldn't stop it, my boyfriend came in and thought to flush the toilet. Immediately the sound went away. As the tank started to fill it stayed quiet. Once it was full, the noise started again. So I kept having to flush the toilet to avoid having the whole place rumble and make strange noises. My boyfriend thought to keep the bathtub tap slightly on. This is a waste of water just to prevent weird rumbling noises, what on earth is wrong with my pipes, this never has happened before? <EOS>
there should be two bolts that hold the caliper on if you undo the bottom one you can lift the caliper out the way and remove the pads once you have done that you need to whined back the piston on the caliper make sure the cap under the bonnet is removed before you do this once that's done put some copper slip on the back off the pads and then place then into the caliper holder  put it all back together and you are done and don't forget to pump the brake pedal after hope this helps <SEP> How do i change the front brake pads on my Seat Leon 1.4S ?

I've been wrestling with this too. The best solution I've found at this point is a checklist item to post a note on the dependent card.

Look for a set of instructions that may appear on one of the panels of the heater.   They may read something like this:  (1) turn the gas dial to "Pilot".   While pressing down on the gas dial, press the red push button a few times until the pilot is lit.   (2) KEEP holding down the gas dial for about 30 seconds.  Then release it.  If the pilot light goes out, you probably need to replace your thermocouple (see below).  If it stays let, turn the gas dial to ON.  Otherwise, turn to OFF and leave the whole thing alone for 5 minutes to let any gas disapate.Replaciing a thermocouple....  This is a common home repair. (A common repair for any gas appliance with a standing pilot light.) The thermocouple is a small metal device that makes sure that there is heat where the pilot light is supposed to be. If it doesn't detect heat, it shuts off the gas valve as a safety precaution. When you are holding down the pilot knob during startup, you are essentially bypassing the thermocouple long enough to heat it up. Over time, the thermocouple degrades and dies - killing the pilot light and preventing it from staying on during an attempt to re-light it.You can call an HVAC guy and for about $100+ or so, they will stop by (after another day or two without heat) and replace this part for you. (If you rent, get your land lord to repair it!) Occasionally you will encounter a crook (they are in all lines of work) who will tell you to replace the furnace and will try to charge you $1000s.Want to try this repair yourself? Take a look at the heater and try to determine the length of the thermo-couple. Use the link below to get an idea of what it looks like and how it is connected. They come in different lengths. If you are in doubt you can error on the side of getting one a little too long. I think they are about $10-20 or so at Lowes. Truck yourself down to the hardware store and get one. Turn off the gas to your house if you feel safer (good time to learn how to do this). Usually just need an adjustable wrench at the outside gas meter.Remove the old thermocouple noting where the screws held it in place. Save the screws! You'll likely need them to install the new one. You may not need some of the parts that come with the new one. This is okay. Install the new one by screwing or snapping it into place. Turn gas back on to house. Relight your pilot light following the procedure you did before. Hold down button for at least a minute. This time the pilot light should stay on! Smell for leaks.Paranoid? Install a CO detector near your hot water heater. Keep the wrench handy for house shutoff... but if you have a leak, first get everyone out. Have never leaks and I've replaced several themocouples, furnace igniters, a gas clother dryer, gas cooktop, and even several whole hot water tanks, so take the precautions you want to, but don't be overly paranoid.You may need to re-light pilot lights of other gas appliances having turned off the house gas.This is a fairly common repair, so learning how to do this will save you a few hundred more bucks when it happens again.Good Luck. <SEP> How do I light a heater that has a push button but no pilot light?

With difficulty.The official access mentioned in the handbook is via a removable panel in the front wheel-arch liner. It will make more sense if you look at the diagrams in the handbook before starting.Put the steering on almost full lock towards the opposite side from the indicator you need to access (not quite full lock, switching the engine off on full lock can cause problems with the electric steering lock disengagement next time you try to start).This allows you to see the oval-shaped access panel, which slides to one side and removes.Carefully reach through the hole left by removing the access panel, locate the rear of the indicator bulb-holder, and carefully twist to remove. It should now be possible to bring the bulb-holder out through the access hole to change the bulb.I believe most dealers actually don't use this method, and instead remove the whole headlamp unit forwards, but I think this requires removal of some of the fastenings for the front bumper fascia.Have a read of some of the articles on the owners forum for more details http://www.meganeownersclub.co.uk/ <SEP> how do i change the front indicator bulb on a 2005 renault megane? <EOS>
Professional sharpeners, the ones who take care of the butchers' and restaurants' knives, are the best, if you're in a big town and have TWO sets of knives.

Buy your sweetie a nice dinner out, then humbly ask afterwards.   OK.  Thread your needle and knot thread at the end.  Approach garment from inside with needle.  Put needle through fabric where you want the button to lie and pull the thread through to follow.  Put the button through the needle and let it fall to the waistline.  Take needle and put it downward through another hole.  Repeat this a 3 times or so, then take a pin and put it under the thread holding the button on on the outside of the garment.  Then continue to stitch the button on until you've gone through the button 12-14 times or so.  Stop stitching when the needle is in the inside of the garment.  Push needle through the garment as close to the center of the button but UNDERNEATH the button and pull thread through.  Wind the thread around the underside of the button 3 or 4 times, then push needle and thread through to inside of garment.  Take a little bit of fabric near the button stitches and push needle/thread through until you've got a little loop left.  Take the needle and put through the loop and pull thread taut.  This will "lock" the stitch.  Repeat a couple times, then cut thread.  Remove the pin from the button on the topside of the garment.  (By using the pin in this way, you put a little "give" between the button and the fabric which will make the button lie correctly.   Regarding the hole in the fabric, you can "darn" the hole first by stitching back and forth across it to make a thread base, then use the thread base to stitch your button to. <SEP> How do you sew a button back on a pair of trousers?

Driving a standard trasmission vehicle takes practice to become profficient. There are several things your mind and body need to learn  to do at the same time or close to the same time. Using first and reverse gears are the most difficult, and down shifting can take a while to get the hang of as well. First you need to get the car moving. This is where first gear is utilized. While slowly letting up on the clutch you will feel a small pressure point in the clutch. This point is where you know to push in the gas just a tad bit and the car (if done correctly) will move forward slowly. It takes getting a full mind and body "feel" of the car, of how the clutch and gas engage each other. While you practice you will jerk a lot and kill the engine. It is getting that combingation of the right clutch release point while giving a bit of gas which starts the car in a forward movement. Once you get the car moving you then shift to second gear. The only gears you need to engage both the gas and clutch at the same time are first and reverse. The other gears can be changed just by pressing in the clutch, changing the gear, letting up on the clutch completely and engaging the gas pedal. Finding the engagement between first, reverse and the proper amount of gas to apply can be difficult at first. Go to a large parking area or a long dirt road and practice. I taught all my kids (8) to drive a standard. We always started with the standard as I feel strongely that once a person masters a standard they will not have any problems with automatics, or trucks, etc. Downshifting is important and can be a bit difficult to master too. Driving a standard requires using much more of your mind and body than an automatic. You have to be aware of the RPMs so you can know when to shift, either up or down. Listening to the vehicle with your mind and feeling how it is responding with your body is required with a standard much more than an automatic. Automatics are easily driven, requires less mental and physical joining with the vehicle and is not as fun. There is more advantages to driving a standard than getting better gas milage or being able to push start it. When driving a standard you can have much more control of the car, and it is simply fun to drive when you are focusing so much of your mind and body with the car. Like I said, just find that point where it feels the clutch has a bit of resistance, slowly press a bit of gas and the car will either go forward, or jerk a lot and then die. As you practice finding that point with the clutch use your whole body to "feel' the car and what it is doing. That is the best advice I can offer anyone who is getting ready to learn to drive a standard. Now, some are just naturals and it comes to them easily, while others have to practive a lot. Do not allow yourself to get discouraged or think you can't do it. Anybody (unless mentally handicapped) can learn to drive a standard. Just remember that even after you have the car functioning and on the regular road you will still require time to get all the proper shifting down pat with further practice. Try downshifting prior to stopping and making the stop as smooth as possible. Also try making your "take off" as smooth as possible as well. By working to make these transistions smooth you will be taking good care of you vehicle. Those who get cocky and refuse to believe they need to learn more finesse in standard transmission minipulation after getting it onto the road are very hard on their vehicles which wears the clutch and other parts more quickly but also put otheers at risk by failing to fully master this type of driving. It is so fun to drive a standard with torc and horse power on a windy road!! It feels like you are one with the car, joined together and it is a blast!! Good luck in learning this type of driving. It is a real skill and if you are patient with yourself and allow yourself to fully master this you will have so muc <SEP> How do i drive a stick???? <EOS>

Sometimes gutters are inadequately designed for the load. You may need to increase the gutter size to a 6" wide system. Otherwise make sure that the gutter is set at the right elevation to the lowest shingles, and is mounted firmly to the facia (years of wear may allow the gutter to sag outward, and away from the roof edge).  A very long run of gutter will have the low end too far below the edge of the roof to catch a big rain.

All these folks wanting you to dis-connect your battery while the car is running didn't offer to pay for the "fried" electronics did they? Don't do that, it can cause ECM and component failure!

Typically you don't fix a heater core, you simply replace it.The heater core is in the passenger compartment usually along the center of the dashboard behind the temperature adjustment/fan controls. You'll have to disassemble the interior to get to it. Either the dash board from the top or from either the passenger or driver side from below.It basically looks like a mini radiator and pokes through the fire wall. You'll need a specialized tool to disconnect the clamps the hold the heater core to the hoses that draw in the water into the heater core. <SEP> how to fix a heater cord in a 1993 Ford Aerostar? <EOS>
First, check and make sure the Breakers are on.Now, if its on, and not blowing cold air, check your furnace plenum, and see if it has frost on it. If it does, then your A/C is low on freon and you need to get it charged.Now, if you dont see frost, it could be your filters are plugged.  Take them out and replace thesm.Or, if you have an electronic air cleaner, wash the filters out.Now, if after all that, you still have no air, then your coil is probably plugged inside the furnace, and you need to go to the A/C place and get a can of cleaner. Then you spray the coil and it will clean the dirt and crud that is caked on.  (You must dissasemble the plenum enough to get to the coil, there should be screws holding it together so you can get to it).Try these and it should get that thing working... If your low on freon, then you have to call the service man to come and fill it, (you have a small leak some place and you may want to pay him extra to do the test to find it), also, if you have the plenum off, you can see the frost and ice on the coils, that tells you its low.Now, for a "quick fix" (if you REALLY need it for a while), put your furnace on!! Put the temperature up to the highest setting to get the flames to kick on. It will thaw the ice in a few minutes and then you can run your A/C until the unit ices up again...This is only a "temperary" measure and you will need to get the unit serviced...I wish you well...Jesse <SEP> how do you fix home airconditioning unit?

You might have a switch on the dash that controls your instrument panel lights, but if not, yeah, that's a wiring problem.  Like someone else said, if you find an online group with someone who has the factory diagrams, so much the better.There are two aftermarket online databases that will have factory wiring diagrams for your car:  Mitchell onDemand (www.ondemand5.com) and Alldata Pro (library.alldatapro.com).  Alldata offers its service (normally USD $3000 a year) for a specific car for about $15 a month...with one subscription, you could pull all the diagrams your heart desires and then simply not renew.Those are the only two answers I have.

Here is what I do.Apply weed and feed.Do not let the yard dry out or the grass goes into a dormant stage.

Instead of using fertilizer I use weed and feed, you can also buy weed and feed with grass seed in it.After you get the lawn looking pretty decent keep adding grass seed through-out the season.The last cut of the year I cut it 2 1/2" as I will get mold in the spring if it is left to long, but this might not apply to everyone.

Pro tips:   You can also just add .json (or /somename.json) to the end of a board or card URL, to get the prompt to save the downloaded file  (e.g. https://trello.com/board/welcome-board/4e6a8095efa69909ba007382/somename.json )  Alternatively, instead of clicking on the "JSON" button, you can right-click on it, and copy the URL  If you have lots of boards that you want to download regularly, you'll have to save all the JSON links somewhere for all your boards, and download each one individually.

Since the OP specifically says:   It doesn't have to use ASCII (it can be Unicode)   I thought I'd share the link for the (mysql / unicode / html) table generator created by a SE user for use on SE I found on superuser . I found it quite useful to get unicode tables (which I sometimes prefer over the Windows-1252 compatible "ASCII" art). And this tool lets you compare the outputs, as well as getting a HTML formatted table, too.  Example to show my workflow: I'm making a web app for my bookkeeper to calculate sales tax and I am doing math on months and quarters so that the tool always automatically displays "last quarter's sales tax info" . Since  I'm always thinking of arrays starting with 0, I needed to embed a simple table outlining the months in each quarter to keep the values sorted in my head.  1) To get the table started, I used this generator (listed on both this and the other QA) with its Excel-like input interface to actually create the data, as the unicode tool wants pre-formatted text. I type in the values then select them and CTRL-C to get my tab delimited table:  Quarter Numbers Names Q1  1, 2, 3 Jan, Feb, Mar Q2  4, 5, 6 Apr, May, Jun Q3  7, 8, 9 Jul, Aug, Sep Q4  10, 11, 12  Oct, Nov, Dec  2) went to senseful's generator and pasted into the input area. I played with each of the 3 options and I liked the Unicode Art option the best:  ╔═════════╦════════════╦═══════════════╗ ║ Quarter ║  Numbers   ║     Names     ║ ╠═════════╬════════════╬═══════════════╣ ║ Q1      ║ 1, 2, 3    ║ Jan, Feb, Mar ║ ║ Q2      ║ 4, 5, 6    ║ Apr, May, Jun ║ ║ Q3      ║ 7, 8, 9    ║ Jul, Aug, Sep ║ ║ Q4      ║ 10, 11, 12 ║ Oct, Nov, Dec ║ ╚═════════╩════════════╩═══════════════╝  Note that for the table to show up correctly on a web page, the character set must be specifically set for UTF-8:  <meta content='text/html; charset=UTF-8' http-equiv='Content-Type'/> <SEP> Is there a webapp to create ASCII art tables?

Trello doesn't (currently) have a way to link items directly to each other.  The approach that works for me is to use a "waiting" -label on items that are stuck. This way they can maintain the context that their lists provide. And since items can have multiple labels it doesn't conflict with any existing labels either.  Of course, if your lists don't contain any context worth maintaining, a separate list for waiting items works well too.  For updating the state of the dependent card, I suggest Bob Snodgrass's answer of adding a checklist item for each prerequisite card, that says "Add note on dependent card X when complete". Or if you need further organization, you could even create a "Dependencies" -checklist on the dependent card with items for each prerequisite card. Then people completing the prerequisite card can just go mark their card as done.  The best feature of Trello is how it keeps all the features simple - so that's probably why there's no dependency, since it would make things more complicate. That said, I think a feature to link items (if kept simple and clear) would be a wonderful addition, as it is a basic element of keeping work organized. <SEP> How do you handle dependencies between cards with Trello? <EOS>

Kind of a long way to do it but it was the only way I can find. I wanted to find out when I subscribed to someone, so to it I went to my YouTube channel and the first thing you see when you get there is your activity on YouTube.

As far as I saw it won't be an exact date so in my case it said a year, it could be anywhere from a year up to a year and 11 months. You still get an estimate of when you subscribed.

To get rid of crabgrass it helps to know its life cycle. When spring soil temps (at a depth of 2"-3") reach 55-60 degrees Fahrenheit, the first crabgrass (also spelled "crab grass") seed will germinate. From mid-summer to fall, crabgrass produces seed. The crabgrass plants (but not the seeds) are killed by frosts in autumn. Preemergent herbicides (also spelled "pre-emergent") come in either granular or liquid form and kill crabgrass seedlings as they germinate.Think of preemergent herbicides as forming an invisible shield across the soil surface that stops emerging crabgrass dead in its tracks. This shield image will serve as a reminder not to practice core aeration on lawns after applying preemergent herbicides, since doing so would only "puncture" the shield. Aerate lawns beforehand, instead. <SEP> How do you kill crab grass? <EOS>

Well to start off Im a Plumber and this is a common problem to say the least.But and I hate to use that word. But you didnt say ifd it was Electric or gas That plays a big part in it. And also what size it is 40/50/75 galIf its  Electric it could be a Element that is outIf its gas The thermostat could have went out on you. Not all the way but the easy way to say this is lets say the HWT thermostat thinks the water is 135DEG- But its only 90DEGThis would cause this problem.If you would like to E-Mail me withModel #- SER#What kind  IE- AO Smith/Bradford white (whatever kind it is)How many galElectric or gasIf you give me the numbers off the tank you wont need to give me the Gallons on it the numbers will tell me everything I need to know.The one thing I can tell you is that most people use there tanks year after year and bever maintain it. And thats Why I replace so many in a year.On the bottom side of the tank you will see a hose bib.It will be brass or plastic. What you need to do is hook a hose up to it and open the valve and let out about 10gal of water or untill its clear. This will flush out any dirt in the tank and give it more life.NOTE- Sometimes when you open a plastic valve they never want to shut off correct and they drip. If this happens to you open it and close it a few times this works sometimes if not then you will need to replace it. ( REPLACE WITH BRASS) You could use a cap on it but this is not the correct way to do this. 1 Other thing even though the tank goes from warm to very hot. You should never put it all the way up. There are a few reasons for this.1 You will burn the He** out of yourself or someone that uses it and does not know you have it that hot  like a child2 it tanks the life out of the tank.

First question: does it have one outlet for the string or two? Have you been able to take the spool off the head? The spool will have some sort of anchor hole through which you thread the string. Cut a piece of line about 20 feet long, thread one end through the hole and pull it even so that you have two equal lengths. The wind both pieces at one time around the spool. There should be an arrow on the spool telling you which way to wind. Wind the string snugly but not tight. Try to lay the wraps down side-by side rather than on top of each other...sort of like a fishing reel. Obviously youll need to wind on top of wraps eventually. Try to "stack" them. Finally, and this is where youll probably go nuts, line the spool up with the head, pull the ends through the exit grommets in the head and push everything back together making sure line remains in the spool, not under it against the head. Cut any excess string that might extend past the guard.This is not the sort of thing that lends itself easily to this format. Most line trimmers work pretty much the same. Check with a neighbor, take things to your local nursery or a shop that does repairs on this type of equipment if I havent been any help. <SEP> How do I replace the plastic thread on a weedeater?

There are two kinds of meters.For the old-fashioned (but still widely used) dial meter, you read the numbers from left to right.

If you are framing or not you need to run a stud on the concrete where you intend to attach it. You drill holes through your (plate) the floor piece to match the holes you drill in the concrete with a masonry bit. You will need some (anchors) that fit the holes you drilled into the concrete. you hammer them in flush with the surface of the concrete. When you buy the anchors it's best to buy the masonry bit at the same time so the sizes are comparable. The anchors should be just about as large as the masonry bit but the should fit snug when tapped into the concrete floor. Then you lay your plate or stud over the sunken anchors. The holes should match up with the anchors providing that you drilled them with the plate in place thus marking your anchors position on the floor. Then your anchors come equipped with the Bolts that you run through the plate and into the concrete which now makes you hire-able in one construction trade. Good luck. <SEP> How do you anchor wood or metal studs into concret floor? <EOS>
chances are if you drilled into a pipe, you'd know it immediately. If you're hanging shelves don't you want to mount them to studs? There are a few things to consider: where your hot water heater is, whether or not your house is multi-story, where on the wall you want to drill. Most reputable plumbers, electricians etc use nail plates, a metal protective plate that fits over where pipe or wire passes through a stud to prevent drywallers or subsequent homeowners from damaging their installations. But for future reference, figure that piping will most always run in the most logical route, from where it enters your house to the furthest outlet. Kitchens, bathrooms etc will usually be designed where they share a common wall. In your case, just because there's a bathroom behind the wall you wish to mount your shelves on doesn't mean the piping is within that wall.  Most times, you'll find the shower/bath, sinks and toilet share a common wall, this is because its simpler to run the piping thus saving costs. If the wall you're drilling into is the same wall your bathroom fixtures are on and/or you have 2  or more stories then use a little care..If they're not then don't worry. Homebuilders take into account this ocurrence and take measures to prevent it. Relax. <SEP> how do i drill a hole in my wall without hitting any water pipes? I just drilled a few holes in a bedroom wall to mount a couple of small shelves.  I used a stud finder and found two areas to drill into to put the supports for the shelves.

There's no sign that anything happened (the drill bit wasn't wet or anything), but I'm still worried.Any tips on 1) figuring out whether I did any damage and 2) preventing me from making a similar mistake in the future? <EOS>

1st althought the first answer is ok. There are some things you need to know.ACID will wear the tank even A little bit will do this.I have been a plumber for 20yrs and I wish you would have said if it was on a well or city water but anyways.there is not real way to get into the tank and scrape it.And I dont know how handy you are but if you arego to your local plumbing supply house and ask them for descaler Tell them what your doing they will know what you need.Shut the water and elec off to the tank and remove the cold pipe from the tank.Pull out the dip tude its about 36inchs or so Depending on what kind you have.Get a 4tf Pc pf copper and drill holes in the pipe only on 3 ft of the pipe SMALL HOLES about 50 to 6o of them.Buy the connector so you can hook up to a hoseAnd buy A good size funnelDrain the HWT at the bottom there is a hose bib open it and drain in.( at the local HD store buy a drill pump About 5 bucks it comes with 2 pc of 5 foot hosesMix the product you got from the dealer mix with water Put a 2 gallon bucket under hose bib pour mix into funnel (funnel is in top of copper pipe u slide into the cold side of tank.With the small pump 1 side of the hose in the bucket 1 side in the funnel Use cordless drill and start the drill up. This will cause the pump to move the mix in 1 big circel And it will shoot out all the little holes in the copper pipe. do this for 5 min wait 20 min and do this again. When you are done hook up hose to pipe and turn on the hose and wash the tank really good to remove any acid in the tank or dirt. then put back together.This is a little bit of work though. And if your tank has this problem then your pipes do too.You should have your water tested and see if a filter system could help you out or a softner. ( Things like this keep money in my pocket this is a common problem) But when a tank gets to a point like this  and its bad Its better to change the tank check the water and do what you can like a filter ect.(( Always remember with any HWT if its a well system every 3 months to 6 months Hook up a hose to the hose bib on the bottom of the tank and turn it on this will cause water to rush into the tank and out the hose when clear water comes out of the hose its clean.MOST Hwts that go bad is cause so much dirt is in the bottom of the tank and it had ate its way through the tank.A little bit of maintiance will save you 1000's in the long run.Also Do you know for sure this is what is in your tank? Alot of times homeowners think this is what it is and its not. Make sure you know what it is before you try to correct the problem.If you need more info and would like my help drop me a line at kos101@yahoo.comGoodluck <SEP> how to quickly remove scaling deposits from inside a electric hot water tank? <EOS>

I totally agree with "thefarmersson" in the above post.  If an A/C system requires recharging, that means that there is a leak in the system.  A/C systems are closed systems that should never need to have additional freon added.  Unfortunately, the parts stores that sell freon don't really stress that a proper diagnosis needs to be made prior to adding additional freon.  Make sure you have repaired the leak in the system prior to adding additional freon.  Assuming that you have already done so, you will need the following: a vacuum pump and preferably a set a of r134a gauges or r12 gauges depending on your year model.  The purpose of using a vacuum pump is twofold.  It helps get all of the moisture out of the system and by pulling a vacuum on the A/C system, you can verify that your repair to the leak in the system is fixed.  To verify that your repair worked, hook up your A/C gauges to the service ports and proceed to operate your vacuum pump.  After running the vacuum pump for 20 minutes, your low side a/c gauge should indicate that the system is under about 30" of vacuum.  Shut off the vacuum pump.  Let the vehicle sit for about 20 minutes and then come back and check the status of your gauges.  If the low side gauge returns to 0 psi, or "atmospheric pressure" it means that outside air entered your a/c system and brought the pressure back up to atmosperic pressure, indicating a leak.  If this occurs, there is no point to charging the system with more freon because it will just leak out, and you will have to go back to the drawing board and attempt to find another leak.  However, if the gauges remains close to 25" to 30" of vacuum, the system is ready for charging.  Hook up a can of freon to the yellow charging line on your a/c gauges.  With the engine off, open up the charging port on the yellow charging line and then open the low side port on your a/c gauges.  This will allow freon to start flowing from the can into your car's a/c system.  Once the freon stops flowing, turn on your truck's engine and a/c system.  The a/c compressor should kick on and start sucking more freon from the charging can.  If the compressor does not kick on, there is an electrical problem present, which would be a totally different subject.  Basically, after the compressor kicks on, continue charging more freon into the system through the low side of the a/c gauges until your gauges indicate about 30-35psi on the low side and 200-250psi on the high side.  If everything is working properly, you should experience a 40 - 45 degree a/c vent outlet temperature.  If this all sounds too complicated, I would reccommend taking the vehicle to a reputable technician in your town who has the proper equipment to do the job.  I don't reccommend these quick charge kits that the parts stores sell because they do not include pressure gauges so you don't know if you over or undercharged your system.  Proper operating pressures are essential for proper operation. <SEP> how do  I recharge the air-conditioner on my dodge pickup? <EOS>
first thing is go to auto zone and get about 7 quarts of tranny oil and get a new filter and gasket,then jack up the front end and then its a good idea to let it cool down first,thentake out the bolts and let it drain into a pan and after it gets all drained out,take the rest of the bolts out and drop the pan and clean off all old sealer on the pan and the tranny,now pull down the old filter and put a new o-ring on the new filter and put it in where the old filter came out of,now put the new gasket on the pan (if you want to,you can put some sealer on both sides or the gasket)and install the pan and gasket and put the bolts back in(just snug them up,dont overtighten them or you could warp the pan).now let the car back down and put in,ill say about 4 quarts of oil and start the car(let it idle)go through all the gears and then back in park,let it run and fill it until its just about a half pint low,then take it for a drive and come back and check the oil,if it needs some fill it to the full mark.i hope this helps you out. <SEP> How do you change the transmission filter on a 98 Ford Contour?

If the problem is the bolt does not line up properly with the stike you can adjust the stike plate. This is sometimes caused by normal settling of the structure. There are several things you can check if this is an existing lock. First check and see if all your hinges are screwed in tight, if the hinge screws have loosened over a period of time this will cause the door to sag slightly and cause a misalignment. Second make sure the screws is the lockset are properly tightened. In the case of typical entry knobs and dead bolts it is best to tighten the latch bolts first and than the screws through the lockset.If every thing else seems up to snuff you can place a small amount of paint on the bolt while the bolt is retracted. Close the door and work the knob or the lockset a couple of times. This will leave a mark on the door jamb or strike plate where the lock bolt is hitting. You will than be able to determine where the strike plate may need be adjusted or the hole enlarged. <SEP> How to repair a door lock that does not line up with the hole in the frame?

Remove as much of the nail polish as possible using a spoon or dull knife.Apply a non-oily nail polish remover to a clean white cloth and gently rub (in only one direction at a time) or blot the spot. Continue until spot is removed. Do not allow nail polish remover to get to the latex backing. Go to the next step to remove nail polish remover.Apply a small quantity of detergent solution to the spot. (To make the detergent solution mix 1/4 teaspoon of a hand dish washing detergent which does not contain lanolin or bleach with 1 quart of water; examples of safe detergents are Dawn® and Joy®.) Use a blotting motion to work the detergent into the affected area. If spot is being removed continue applying detergent and blotting with a white paper towel until spot is removed. Rinse with tap water using a spray bottle, blot to remove excess moisture.Spray lightly with water, do not blot this time; apply pad of paper towels and brick and allow to dry.If there is still some stain on the carpet and blotting is not removing it, then moisten the tufts in the stained area with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Let stand for on (1) hour. Blot and repeat until carpet is stain free. Light will cause peroxide to change back to water so no rinsing is necessary.
