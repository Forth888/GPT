I f you take your time and are particular to make a good job tiling is remarkably easy, just remember to tack a level wooden batten to the wall for your first tile to sit on and then when the wall is tiled remove the batten and tile in the space below, the reason for this is that no room is square and it looks really bad if you end up with a sliver of tile or a gap filled with grout, so always space your tiles first see how it looks and then start with a half tile on the horizontal and vertical, never ever start with a full tile, as if you start with a half you can make your tiles go bigger and smaller with the wall, try to make sure that where the tile edges meet each other they are fairly level( if they are not just pull the tile out where necessary) and not dipping in or proud of each other as you dont want any brown edges of the tiles showing through the grout having said that grouting hides a multitude of sins,clean off any adhesive as soon as possible, take special care and after a day grout it, only do small sections at a time say two foot square as grout sets quick on a dry joint, when you have grouted a small area then take a grouting tool or the round end of a pencil will do and rub the joints, clean with a almost dry sponge then rub joints again filling in any pin holes then clean again, repeat for the rest of the wall. If the wall is very bad, before you tile you could always level the wall with plasterboard or some waterproof equivalent. Always use waterproof adhesive and grout,  .im not a tiler I am a plasterer but recently have been doing a fair bit of tiling and although a little slow and fussy I have been delighted with the results its much easier than you might think.<SEP>How to set tile?<EOS>
Usually when the bottom edges and corners of the shingles start to warp or curl, when small pieces break off the edges or small holes appear in the shingles, or when it becomes obvious the granules are coming off in a few places. If you have many of these symptoms then it won't be long before you have a leak and then things get a bit more urgent.Hint: in the winter many landscapers take up part time work as roofers. So if you have someone come to give you an estimate and they drive a landscaper's truck, back off.  I have known someone who had this and the new roof leaked worse than the old one.<SEP>How can you tell when your roof needs replacing?<EOS>

If you are talking about plumbing pipes you shouldn't be able to smell them because there is supposed to be a trap in all drains which keeps water in it at all times unless it hasn't been used in a long time and the water has evaporated.There is supposed to be a vent on all drains and the water in the trap makes the sewer gas and odor go up the vent instead of into the house.If you have drains that haven't been used in a while run some water in them.If this doesn't work and you have a garbage disposal then that is probably where the odor is coming from.I personally don't like them,mainly because of odor problems and they can help to clog your pipes.<SEP>how do i fix smelly pipes?<EOS>
Spray some brake cleaner or carb cleaner....etc. around the seals and see if it affects the engine.It sounds like you may have some trash in the carb though... take it off and apart and blow it out with compressed air and carb cleaner through any and all holes you see.

You would have to hire a company specialized in lead paint removal.  I believe most states require lead paint removal be performed by licensed professional because of the health risks involved.

Well, better to use a spirit level. Don;t have one? take a water pipe, around 6 or 8 mm dia. Fill the water. If youe machine has legs, take one as a master. mark a distance from ground say 100 mm for all the legs. keep the one end of the tube at the master leg" 100 mm mark. ensure water level inside tube is inline with the mark. Let some one to hold. Take the other end to other legs. Hold it along the mark, Now you can see whether this leg is Lower/Higher than master. I advise better buy a spirit level in market.

Solar water heaters perform three basic operations before the hot water comes out of your tap:1. Energy Collection: Sunlight is collected and converted to heat energy.The solar collector is mounted on or near your home facing south. As the sunlight passes through the collector’s glazing, it strikes an absorbing material. This material converts the sunlight into heat, and the glazing prevents the heat from escaping in a similar manner to leaving a car parked in the sun with its windows rolled up. The temperature inside a glazed solar collector on your roof can easily reach 150°C when there is no heat transfer fluid flowing through it.The two most common types of solar collectors used in solar water heaters are glazed flat plate and evacuated tube collectors. A glazed flat plate collector consists of a shallow rectangular box with a transparent glass “window” covering a flat black plate. The black plate is attached to a series of parallel tubes or one serpentine tube through which air, water, or other heat transfer fluids pass.An evacuated tube collector consists of several individual glass tubes, each containing a black metal pipe through which the heat transfer fluid passes. The space between the pipe and the glass tube is “evacuated,” so the air is removed.Although uncommon, unglazed plastic collectors can be used as a seasonal solar water heating system. However, they are used mostly for pool heating. Each collector has its advantages, and each can perform well if matched with the proper, well-designed, storage unit.2. Energy Transfer: Circulating fluids transfer the collected energy in the form of heat to a storage tank.Heat energy is transferred from the collector to the water storage tank. In some water heaters, hot fluid is pumped from the collector to the storage tank. The pump is powered by electricity that either comes from an electrical wall outlet or a small photovoltaic module located beside the collector.In other types of solar water heaters, the sun heats the storage tank directly, so the fluid in the collector is heated and rises naturally to a storage tank above the collector. This type of solar water heater is often referred to as a thermosiphon system. It does not  require an electric pump. Passive solar and solar photovoltaic-powered systems will continue to operate even if there is a power outage. The products that require electricity from a wall outlet will not operate during a power outage.3. Energy StorageSolar-heated water is stored in an insulated tank until you need it. Hot water is drawn off the tank when tap water is used, and cold make-up water enters at the bottom of the tank.Solar water heaters tend to have a slightly larger hot water storage capacity than  conventional water heaters. This is because solar heat is available only during the day and sufficient hot water must be collected to meet evening and morning requirements.<SEP>how does solar water heaters work?<EOS>
Try here:  http://www.ehow.com/how_17787_remove-super-glue.htmlSuperglue (cyanoacrylate) has many uses. Besides the typical household function of sticking things together, it's used in surgical procedures and even in crime labs to develop unseen fingerprints. Originally marketed as Eastman #910 in 1958, this stuff is sneaky and it goes everywhere if you don't keep an eye on it.          Steps:  1.   Clean up any glue that is still wet by blotting it with a white paper towel or terry cloth towel.    2.   Soak the object in warm soapy water if possible and try rubbing off as much as you can.    3.   Pour a little bit of acetone-base nail polish remover on a white terry cloth.    4.   Dab at the dried glue until it dissolves.    5.   Use extra fine sandpaper to remove dried glue from the surface of an object.    6.   Try a product called Goof-Off or Z-7 Debonder.        Tips:   Hold a folded white cloth on the back of fabrics to keep the acetone from soaking through other layers.     Acetone may affect colors or melt plastic fibers, such as some nylons or carpet. Test it on a hidden area first.        Warnings:   Don't use solvents such as gasoline or paint thinner.<SEP>How can I get super glue off the carpet?<EOS>

Buy a spline tool at Home Depot for about $2.00. Buy a roll of screen and a roll of the grey spline. Roll out the screen material over the frame first without cutting it. Take the spline and on one side, use the tool and push the spline and screen into the groove up the entire length, pull the opposite side tight and run the spline on that side the same way. Then, finish by doing the top and bottom the same way. It is best to get new gasket or spline.

Replace the drain valve on the bottom of the tank with a "moisture ejector".  It automatically spits a tiny amount of air / water every time the compressor motor stops.

First read your manual and find out how much and what kind of oil your car needs.  This is very important on newer cars whose tolerance is so small.Then go to the autoparts store and ask for a filter for your car and get the oil you need.  You should also have an oil filter wrench.  I reccomebd the ring kind not the kind tha fits over the top ore the visegrip kind.You might also want to get something conviniant to catch the oil in and tote it around.  You will need to take it back to a place that collects old oil.Then get on your back and find the drain plug.  Wait till you car is cool though.  Undo the plug and let the oil drain into the pan you got.  Next you need to find your oil filter.  You have a new one so you should be able to look for something the same shape.  it may be a different color though.Turn the old filter counter clock wise.  be ready though oil will come out a small amount anyway.Turn it over on your drain pan and let the rest run out of the filter.Put a small amount of oil on your finger and rub the gasket on the new filter.  Put it where the old one was and hand tighten only.  If it is easy to do without spilling oil you you should also prime the filter by pouring some oil into it.Replace the filter and the drain plug.  Fill you car oil fill (under the hood) to the recommended amount.  Replace the cap.  I have forgotten to do that a couple of times.  Boy did my wife get mad when her car was smoking.Mkae sure to take your oil and filter to a place which collects them.  Usually most chain autoparts stores will.M<SEP>how do you change car oil?<EOS>
You'll probably have to replace the stem......turn the cold water supply off to the faucet.  I'm assumming this is for a lavatory so there should be a cutoff valve underneath.

Takes 3 things to keep a pool clear and sparkling: 1) Circulation2) Filtration3) Proper water chemistry.Correct all 3 of these and the pool will respond. How long do you run the pump each day?

The HT leads are the high tension leads that link the spark plugs to the distributor and are very easy to replace. Firstly you need to check manufacturers specifications for ht leads because if wrong leads are put in it could cause all sorts of problems. Purchase the leads then simply change one at a time starting from cylinder 1 and making sure it goes to the correct connection on the distributor cap. One of the leads which we in the automotive trade refer to as the king lead looks slightly different to the rest and connects the centre of the distributor cap to the ignition coil. Failure to put the leads in the right place on the cap will result in the spark occuring in the wrong cylinder at the wrong time as leads are placed on the distributor cap in the firing order of the engine. This will certainly show itself as a loss of compression(engine power)<SEP>how to replace ht leads?<EOS>

Year, make and model would help here. If you have a rack and pinion unit, yes remove the return line at the pump (usually the hose with a clamp on it) than turn the wheel back and fourth lock to lock a few times and this will purge most of the fluid out.

Both systems could be flushed in this manor, Remove return line and cap the nipple on the reservoir, put return line over or in a container to catch waste fluid, pour proper type of fluid into reservoir as vehicle is running while another person turns wheel slowly back and fourth this will effectively flush clean the system ( 1 or 2 quarts should do).<SEP>How do you completely drain the power steering fluid?

The glass doors ride on wheels in a track on the top rails. They are removed typically by holding onto the door and then lifting the wheels out of the track and the doors come off. Sometimes they are just riding in a track and you can lift them straight up and out, and sometimes there are smaller holes in the track that you have to line the wheels up with in order to get them out. If you take off the doors you might not have to take off the rails if it is OK with the rails in place (and then you can put the doors back when the baby grows up!)Once you take the doors off then you can see how the rails are affixed to the tub/wall. Typically there will be screws on the end of the rail that extend into the wall (typically the bottom rail isn't screwed into the tub). Take the screws out. The top rail should come off pretty much when you take out the screws. The bottom rail also has silicone sealant on it. You can carefully cut away the biggest parts of the silicone to get the bottom rail off. Then you can carefully scrape off the remaining silicone.Hope this helps.

Is your engine a Vortec 4.3L It could be a lot of things.....If you have oil in your antifreeze and antifreeze in your oil, it is your head gasket.   If not,Start with the basics,  Replace the sparkplugs, cap and rotor, replace your airfilter and pcv valve, if you haven't already done so replace your O2 sensor. Put a code reader on the engine and see if you get any error codes, this may help you track it down. You may have an electrical short that is happening when the engine gets warm enough.Good Luck!<SEP>how to tell if your head gasket needs to be replaced on a 1996 jimmy? having trouble..brown spots under truck after parked for awhile..sputtering out like it wants to die..does die then wait 10 mins and it starts again and goes a little ways and stalles out again..changed the fuel pump and fuel filter told it could be o2 sensor or head gasket or needs tune up<EOS>
You are dealing with a compression faucet. The valve opens and closes via a valve stem. That stem has splines on the end of it, underneath the handle. The handle has ridges in the backside hole that mate with the splines. If the handle is spinning around on the valve stem, what has happened is that the splines and or ridges have worn and do not mate properly. Since the usual reason that you cannot remove a handle after removing the screw beneath the index cap is corrosion between the mating surfaces of splines and ridges, I doubt this is your problem since the knob is spinning around the valve stem. Look on the side of the handle for some sort of set screw. These are fairly small and usually require an allen wrench to remove them. If there is none, try prying the knob off with a large flathead screwdriver under the handle. Place something such as a paint stir stick between screwdriver and any surface that may become damaged. If that doesn't work you could purchase a faucet handle puller for the job.Once you have the handle removed most likely you'll need to replace the valve stem. You will need to turn off the water to the valve. If the shower does not have shut offs somewhere nearby ( most likely it won't) and you are wanting to remove the hot water valve stem, you should be able to shut off the cold water supply to the hot water heater to avoid having to use the shut off for the entire house. By turning off the cold water supply located on the line coming into the hot water heater, you are in effect shutting off pressure to all hot water faucets in the house. Then untighten the packing nut that holds the valve stem in place. You should now be able to continue backing out the valve stem until it comes out of the seat. Take this to a hardware store and replace. Why did all this happen in the first place? The screw under the index cap became loose and allowed the handle to start grinding the splines off. Hope the info helps.<SEP>how to remove old shower knobs? I have an old house built in the 40's and the hot knob just spins and spins and won't completely turn off the water any more.

Most showerheads hand-screw off. My showerhead is like that. However, be careful when you unscrew it. Make sure you have a pipe wrench and clamp the pipe (where the showerhead connects to) tight. You don't want to turn or break the pipe that's sticking out of the wall. You can get teflon/plumbers tape at Home Depot. Make sure you put at least 1-2 layers of the tape around the threads in the pipe before installing the new showerhead. This will help against leaks. Again, don't forget the pipe wrench and hold the pipe while screwing in the showerhead.Here is a link I found on the DIY webpage:http://www.diynetwork.com/diy/ba_faucets_fixtures/article/0,2037,DIY_13710_2272541,00.html<SEP>How do I replace my showerhead?<EOS>

Your problem is the main drain and NOT the P-Trap. If it was only the P-trap then the neighbor wouldn't be having a problem. Both your drains may meet behind the wall before they go into the drain pipe. If that's the case there may be a problem behind the wall and that is the landlords problem. Unless you want what you dropped down I wouldn't worry about taking apart your p-trap. The landlord should send someone to the roof to drop a snake down the drain vent and remove the clog. Should you want to remove the p-trap you will need an adjustable wrench to remove the two nuts that hold it in place. You may want to go to a home store or plumbers shop and buy another p-trap if it looks nasty because it might fall apart when you try to remove the nuts. You will need an 11/2" for the kitchen and 1 1/4 for a bathroom. BE AWARE THAT WHEN YOU REMOVE IT ALL THE WATER THAT IS BACKED UP INTO THE DRAIN PIPE IS GOING TO START GUSHING OUT OF THE PIPE.

I live upstairs & the lady in  the apt. next to me is having problems with hers also, (I assuume because we share a common pipe, which is past our seperate drains. According to our leases we are responsible for the plumbing bill if we caused the problem!! Neither she nor I can afford large plumbing expense.  I was told by a friend that since the trap is metal (galvinized) it would be easy to repacel due to the fact that it is not only clogged but  also probably quite corroded.  She informed me that it  not a difficutl task  you just must use caution !!I understand, with that said, her son was going to try to use a "Shop Vac" & plastic tubing to try to suck out the objects down there. but I don't know if that would be sufficient ,because I believe some has gone past the trap!!!<EOS>
Could be a problem thermostat.  Could also be a gas flow issue, meaning one or more of the gas exhaust vents has become clogged (e.g., with burned food) thereby limiting the total gas into the oven, which would limit the maximum temperature the oven could reach.To answer your main question, your oven works just like your home heating--a thermocouple/thermostat determines the temperature it is, and depending on the temperature you want, it lets gas flow or not (usually full on or full off).

If I remember right, most older GE dryers do not have removable back panels. The front panel comes off instead. There is srews at the bottom of the front panel at floor level. After you remove those, pull the bottom outward a ways. From there, you can disengage it from the top, and have access to the area under the drum where the motor and belt tensioner pulley assembly is located. On GE dryers that open like this, the back of the drum is mounted to a shaft that goes through a bearing in the back of the dryer accessible through a small removable panel. The front of the drum rides on 2 plastic shoes mounted to the front panel. Check the bearing, guide shoes, and tensioner pulley.

If the battery is showing fully charged from the charger but runs out quickly or does not charge at all, I would suspect a bad battery.  Take a multimeter and read voltage (Make sure the meter is set to DC!).  No matter the charge on the battery the voltage should remain the same... to check the charger, put the battery in series with the charger/meter( this time turn the meter to Ampere setting 10A max first - if you get nothing, then you can adjust to the mA setting) and you should get a corresponding reading to the manufactures specs.NiCd (Nickle Cadnium) and Li-Ion (Lithium Ion) have dissimilar characteristics on charging rituals...e.g.  NiCads like to be FULLY discharged before recharging - this lengthens the life of the battery while if you truly discharge a Li-Ion, you'll probably never be able to use it again.Also, schwinn products might be sold at walmart.

Your truck has IFS, independent front suspension. The most you can get from the suspension is about 1.5inch lift, by adjusting the torsion bars to max. This is not recommended because of the added torsional stress on the bars, and your ride will be rough. You can gain a couple inches doing a body lift, again not recommended due to complications with the steering angles, brake lines, cooler lines, etc... and your bumper wont line up with the body, which looks goofy.On a brighter note... you can lift the rear of the truck easily. Adding extra leafs can gain a few inches and increase the load capacity. You can use lift blocks, Max 3inch or you will get axle hop, also this must be done with correctly designed parts to be safe. Finally, you can put large springs in, which is your best bet.If you do it... Do it right. Buy a lift kit from Rancho, Skyjacker, etc. Which ever you choose, unless you are mechanically inclined, get it done professionally.<SEP>how to build a lift kit for a 2000 chevy 4x4?<EOS>

check all the fluids. the coolant should be a mid dark to mid light green, with almost a sweet odor to it. check the oil and tranni fluid. the older the fluid, the thicker it gets. for the winter time, a thinner weight oil is usually reccommended because oil thickens up at lower temps and it takes a longer time to oil the engine. a lighter oil means better start up protectionbeefy tires are needed unless you have all season tires. tire pressure should be checked at least twice a month. also, make sure to check if your heater works.<SEP>How should you prepare your car for winter?<EOS>
Older homes often have receptacles and fixtures that are ungrounded, and many local codes do not require that they be rewired so they're grounded. Still, grounding is worth adding to your system because it adds protection against electrical shock. Grounding provides a third path for electricity to travel along, so if there is a leak of any sort, it will flow into the earth rather than into the body of a person who touches a defective fixture, appliance, or tool.An electrical system is grounded with a grounding rod driven at least 8 feet into the ground outside the house or connected to a cold water pipe. Each individual branch circuit must be grounded as well, either with a separate wire that leads to the neutral bar of the service panel or with metal sheathing that runs without a break from each outlet to the panel. (In theory, electrical outlets can be grounded individually, but this is impractical.)<SEP>How do you ground a home? I am looking for details about a "ufred" method.

If the cables have gone bad, they will have wrapped up around the drive spool, kinked, etc. Your only option there is to replace them. The part you need for that is called the "window lift regulator". Dorman makes aftermarket regulators that may fit your car. The motors also have a gear drive and the "dogs" sometimes strip out. I repair those by removing the motor, removing the plate over the drive head (one screw) clean out, and use 3 nylon nuts (solid nylon, not "nyloc") as the driv dogs.Here is how to on these types.Remove door panel and inner moisture barrier.Unplug motor connection and remove the three screws which hold motor in place, These may be "Torx" headed. Remove the motor from the door.To remove glass, you will need to do some drilling. Put window glass in a position where you can see the two rivets holding it to the regulator slide. Carefully use a punch to knock out the pin in each rivet, then drill rvet heat out. Remove the glass and lay aside (carefully of course). You will have to twist window, but it will come out. be sure to remove the inner "wiping" seal on the top of the door.Now all you have left is the regulator. It is held by two studs/nuts at the top, and two rivets ant the bottom which must also be punched, and drilled out.Reassembly is the reverse of removal. Instead of riveting back in place, I use 1/4" blots, nuts, and lockwashers. On the glass, use bolts and Nyloc nuts, ore a plain nut held with epoxy on the threads. The white insulators snap together in the galss. The bolt goes through them.

Portable generators are noisy. If you have neighbors nearby or the noise is unbearable in your house here are some ideas. - Choose an operating location as far away as possible. Note that a larger gauge wire is needed to reduce voltage drop as line length increases. Reducing line loss is required to minimize power loss and to ensure maximum power is available to the house. Lights will flicker less when heavy loads are attached. - Change the exhaust system. Noise from the portable generator systems comes primarily from two sources, the engine block and the exhaust system.. With an air cooled engine there is little you can do about block noise. Some engines can have a larger muffler attached or make other changes to the exhaust system. Merely mounting exhaust pipe vertically will noticeably reduce noise. - Build a noise shielding enclosure. This could be as simple as a piece of plywood to reflect sound away from the house to a separate shed to hold the generator. Design your enclosure with safety in mind. Provide adequate air circulation and ventilation to prevent heat buildup and to remove carbon monoxide. - If the noise bothers your neighbors, invite them over for coffee or offer to run line to their home to power the freezer or a few lights. Talk to them before starting the engine, ask they let you know if the noise is bothersome before they phone the police or harbor any resentment. A little diplomacy can go a long way. - Last resort, shut off the engine or buy a quiet generator.<SEP>How do iI make a loud generator more quit?<EOS>
How can I recursively set ownership of Google Drive files and folders?<SEP>I created a command-line tool to handle this.  After following the setup instructions on the GitHub project, you can run the tool with a specified path prefix and the email address of the new owner:  python transfer.py PATH-PREFIX NEW-OWNER-EMAIL  After getting authorization from OAuth, it will recursively walk the Google Drive account it got authorization to, match against the path prefix (ignoring non-matches), and then transfer ownership to the new email. If the new email address indicates a user who isn't even shared on the item yet, it will handle that as well. The current owner will not lose access, but the new or old owner can revoke it.  I should note that it's not always possible to transfer ownership of an item in Drive. For example, it's not possible to move ownership for an item from G Suite (Google Apps for Work) account to a normal GMail account. It can be shared (which the script will do), but ownership transfer will fail.<EOS>

The EGR Valve Location is typically housed on the intake manifold (the very top of the engine)( I think it is on the drivers side next to the throttle body)   It's purpose is to recirculate a portion of the exhaust gas back into the intake manifold so it has to be connected to the intake manifold.  It is a round diaphram, will typically have a Vacuum hose connected to it, and typically held on by two bolts.  You should also use plenty of light and inspect the vacuum lines connected to it, they tend to crack and loose vacuum which would throw a code.

You'd be money and sleepless-nights ahead if you just cutout the area around the toilet ALL-THE-WAY back to the joists.. You are asking for an eventual dry-rot situation.Do this test...Make sure you are in a joist space (IE not over a joist) and you are not close to a water pipe. At 3ft away from the toilet, drill a 1/4" hole all the way through..  note the effort required..  repeat the test at 2ft and at 6" from the toilet ring... is the floor SOLID at each spot?  If so, then your plan will work... though you should give the floor a week to dry out.1/4 ply is NOT a structural layer.. its only used to underlay floorcoverings, like vinyl.  I would take ALL the 1/4 layer off and re-evaluate whether to do a sub-floor splice of 3/4 ply around the toilet.Also, try to evaluate WHY the wax ring was leaking... IS the toilet flange flush with the existing floor?  If not and its below the floor by any more than 1/4", you may have your answer WHY!!  You need to have the flange FLUSH to the final grade..

4.0 liter probably doesnt have a belt tensioner.  Most 4 liter dodge engines you have to loosen the idler pully and then the screw on top of the idler pully screws the idler down when you loosen it.  I could be wrong but I know that most 4 liters i have done are this way no tensioner just an idler pully that slides down when you loosen it. If it does have a tensioner then you should be able to use a 1/4 in ratchet.  Insert into the hole on the end of the tensioner and pull back.  I wrote to someone before about how to change a belt on a jeep.  This is what I said.  not that easy there is no tensioner on a 4.0 liter. First you need a 15mm socket. There is a idler pully on the drivers side of engine in front of teh power steering pump. Loosen the bolt in the center of the pully. Do not take all the way out just loosen a few turns. Then once you have the idler loose you need a 13mm socket and extension. Look down on the back side of the idler kind of on top. THere is a bolt that is about 4 inches long that goes down through the back of the pully. Loosen that bolt and the idler pully will slide down taking tensioin off the belt. Do this until you fel the belt is loose enough to remove. Once you have the belt off put new belt back on follow the diagram on the sticker under the hood. Follow the steps in reverse order to tighten. First tighten the bolt until the belt can be twisted about 1/4 to 1/2 side to side. once the belt is tight enough go ahead and tighten the nut on the idler pully and your done. Before you start it is helpfull to look at the bolt on the back and look where the threads are this helps you to get correct tension. also make sure you have the sticker for the diagram under the hood before you start. If you sont make sure you draw the belt or get one. It can be a pain to put back if you have no diagram. Well sorry so long but wanted to be specific.

Well, you need to remove the upper and lower steering column covers. Take out the tilt wheel lever, and the retaining screws (usually on the bottom cover), and gently pry the covers apart.

The generator has an external voltage regulator that must be checked for proper wiring and operation before condeming the generator.  The wiring to the generator must be checked as well.  The brushes on the generator can be replaced while the generator is still on the vehicle.  This is usually all that goes wrong with a generator.  Replacing the generator is somewhat complicated when the engine is still in the vehicle. I'll give it a shot but its been quite a while since I've done one.   The generator turns a blower that cools the engine located the big semicircular housing on top of the engine.  There is an oil cooler that sticks up inside this housing that has to be removed to get the housing off.  It is secured with 4 bolts if memory serves.  Remove the two 10 mm bolts on either side of the blower housing. You have to remove the generator pulley nut to take apart the pulley to remove the belt. Remember which shims went where.  Shims are used to tighten the belt. Remove the generator clamp and remove the generator stand or bracket.  After that stuff is out of the way you should be able to lift the blower housing to access the oil cooler bolts.  You will also have to remove the carburetor.  (Just 2 bolts, some hoses and a cable clamp).  When and if you get the housing out there is a large 36mm nut holding the blower fan to the generator that will have to be removed to transfer the fan to the new generator.  This job is a lot easier if the engine is removed from the vehicle.  Reverse the instructions above to reassemble.  I always wanted to say that!!  Other techs will understand.<SEP>how to install a generator on a 69 vw beetle baha? the battary keeps going dead and the red light in the speedometer is always on.

Get a cassette tool to remove the cassette. The axle should then unbolt easily from the hub. Are you sure you need new bearings? It should now be obvious where the bearings are (pay attention to which direction the sit in the hub). At this point, I would take the old bearings to a bike shop (assuming that they actually need to be replaced) and have the mechanic match your old bearings with some new ones. Don't forget to clean out any old grease from the hub and axle. Then pack the new bearings with grease (you can buy grease at the bike shop, too) and put everything back together. be careful not to over or under tighten the axle bolts.<SEP>How to change ballbearings in a bike?

The white stuff is efflorvescance, its calcium deposit that exits the brick through moisture.If not too bad you can do like other answer said wait to dry out then scrape or brush off.If its bad... like a thicker shiny white its much harder.We use a Surekleen product that helps break it up,apply with a brush and alot of scraping.This is one of the biggest dilemnas in masonry cleaning.For best results youll have to do it many times with dry time in between.Once its off and you are certain the wall is very dry ,like in the summer then use a masonry waterproofing on the wall so no more moisture gets inside the brick.Until the moisture is completely dissapaited from internal part s of masonry wall,the salts will continue to come out every year.Thats why its important to seal with a waterproofing thats made for brick and block walls.<SEP>How do you remove white (salt?) deposits from the brick on a house?

Unless you remedy the conditions that are allowing the mold to grow, it will eventually find its' way back, assuming you could get rid of all of it in the first place.  I'm guessing that you have a very damp crawlspace.  You need to identify the source of the water/moisture and eliminate it.  I'm also guessing that there is not enough ventilation under your house.  At the very least, you probably need to provide additional vents.  A properly ventilated and dry crawlspace is not conducive to the growth of mold.Good luck with your situation.<SEP>how do you get rid of mold under a house?

Very good description! When there is only one cable in the switch box with a red wire then the black is hot and red is the switch leg(called one-upping) and white is the common/neutral. Hook the black and red to the switch and nut the whites together and close up. In the ceiling box The black wire feeds the switch so you tie it to a hot circuit(should already be done but will usually be black) and the red you tie to the hots of the ceiling fan black and blue and white to white and green to green. This is if there is only one switch in the wall! If there are two switches then its a little different. What has happened here with a single switch is that the fan allows for two but aren't necessary.

Hi Deb,Simple answer--Only way to externally identify a 440 Sixpack is to measure the counterweight thickness of the harmonic balancer....................Some spam about that,if ya wanna wade thru it >>>>A 440 Sixpack is maybe THE hardest engine to identify of all the American Hi performance engines"HP" is Hi Performance,,,and was simply stamped on enginesthat got "HP" parts bolted-in on the assembly line.No Difference in HP and HP2,none whatsoeverNo Number on the engine identifies them.Besides the 3-2bbl Intake Manifold,,there's only ONE external feature,,,and that's the Harmonic Balancer/Crankshaft Dampener thingie.Only Sixpacks had that particular dampener.Internally--the obvious & visible differences were Few also.*Pistons had 4 valve releifs in the dome,,,all other 440's had only 2*Connecting Rods-'69 part# 3462426 Casting #1851535Those were "standard 440 rods" but with extra inspection.("Magnaflux" Crack checking,I 'bleive.???)In '70 Rods were changed to Casting # 2951908These are actual "Sixpack Rods",,Sixpacks were the only engines that used them.They MIGHT be in some '69's*Camshaft Sprocket had a 3-bolt attatchment.All other 440's had One center bolt holding on the Cam Gear.Obviously,,in order to VERIFY any of those things means WRENCH WORK,,Remove Cylinder Heads,or Oil Pan,or Timing Cover.........................................................Identifying the Balancer is easiest.It has 2 distinguishing features:#1 It has the ol' Offset Bolt Pulley---One of the bolts which holds the Pulley to the Balancer is Offset,,so that the Pulley will only install in That certain position.(which makes NO difference anyway???)The Offset Bolt Hole is the one which is aligned with the Timing Mark on the Balancer.There's a LATER 440 Balancer that looks VERY SIMILAR,except it's got a LITTLE Thicker Counterweight & All the Bolt Holes are the same--pulley will install in any position.It can be "tricky" to the eye to tell the 440 balancer from the SIXPACK one.#2) Sixpack has the Thinnest of all the counterweights,,among Mopar's counterweighted balancers.The Weight is .20" Thick on a SixPack,,and its .25" on the one that "looks like a Sixpack"The Sixpack is a little over 3/16",The Other is a little over 1/4"That's a Small Difference,,,,.050" ,,about  1.25 mm or 1/16"Easiest way to measure it without taking the Pulley Off:Get a 3/16" and 1/4"  Drill Bit,,a Good Light,,,and crawl under the car.Try them in the gap between the Pulley and the Balancer."Eyeball" Each bit's thickness in comparrison to the Thickness of the COUNTERWIEGHT.(Using the Straight end/SmoothShank part of the Bit,,,right? :)It makes like a "feeler gauge",,and the Difference will be obvious to see if you get a good close look at the Balancer.Here's an Ugly Old picture to see the Counterweight.Sorry it's not nice,,,Pics are SCARCE.At least the Counterweight is Clear and Obvious.On the page,,the 1st pair of Rusty looking balancers---Notice the one on the LEFT looks even & symmetricalon it's face,,surrounding the bolt holes.The one on the RIGHT is "LIKE" the Sixpack's.It has the Eccentric,Crescent Shaped Counterweight on it's face,In that pic,,the Weight is a thin ring on the Bottom,and it's Thick/Wide at the top.I hope I explained that to make any sense,,it's pretty obvious to see.http://www.moparts.com/Tech/Archive/bb/22.htmlI'd suggest using the "drill bit thickness gauge"in an area where the Weight's Diameter is Larger,,,such as from about 9 O'clock to 3:00 in that Pic.It will be easier to See the Thickness at the shallower De<SEP>How do you identify a 6 pack 440 motor?

The dimming circuit for the mirror works on the principle of differential - i.e. if the light coming at the mirror from the rear of the car as detected by a sensor on the face of the mirror is significantly brighter then the light striking the back of the mirror as detected by a photo sensor on the backside of the mirror, the circuit energizs the electrochromic surfce in the mirror (or, on older models, activates a motor that physically tilts the mirror).A quick check - there should be a small hole in the face of the mirror, and a sensor on the rear - are they covered by hanging objects?Also - is the mirror dirty?

Depends on the router.  Some have a lock mechanism to lock the shaft and disable the power switch.  Some you have to use two wrenches.  In either case, you will need a box end wrench to loosen the collett that holds the bit.  As you are looking at the business end of the router, the collett needs to rotate counter-clockwise to loosen the bit.  If the bit is still stuck, you will need to get a pair of pliers to GENTLY pull the bit out of the chuck using as light a pressure as you can.  If you have soft jawed pliers, that would be perfect.  You don't want to squeeze the bit so hard, the carbide chips or cracks.  As you are pulling on the bit, keep the shaft in the locked position and pull and rotate gently.  If the bit is still stuck, remove the collett completely and use a flat bladed screw driver to gently pry apart the flutes in the chuck.  Be patient, be gentle.  You can also look on the Sears website for an owners manual for your specific router.<SEP>how do you change a bit out on a craftsman wood router?<EOS>

Do you have the thermostat in your part of the building? Introduce it to some cold. Put a fan on it or even ice cubes.Many people accidentally do the opposite of this, even me! Cold house with the thermostat turned up? I had moved a lamp directly underneath the thermostat. The lamp heated the thermostat so it got a false reading and wouldn't turn the furnace on.If you don't have access to the thermostat and wanted to do this somewhere in the wires or at the furnace, you would need to know enough not to have needed to ask this question.  With computer boards inside modern furnaces, a crossed wire can mean a $300 repair. Don't touch unless you're an electronics tech that can read a circuit diagram and figure out what would need to be done safely.A plug-in space heater would be your next best bet. I favor the oil filled ones that look like old fashioned radiators for even heating. Don't turn it on and off. Leave it on all the time at a low setting.<SEP>How do I override the thermostat?

If I understand the question, you want to know what the problem may be when the problem IS NOT that the system is undercharged? If the system is fully charged is your compressor cycling? If not, do you have power to the compressor? The system may have enough charge but if the pressures on the high side and the low side are not right the system will not operate properly. If the high side pressure is too high there is probably a restriction and a high pressure switch will shut the compressor off to prevent more pressure from building up. How do you know it doesn't need to be charged? If a shop looked at it they probably checked the pressure (or they should have) so find out what they were. Need more info for a more specific diagnosis.<SEP>How do you know what parts to replace on air conditioning in your vehicle, when its not a charge needed?

The smart thing to do is if you are having trouble with a car thermostat (this is a car forum) replace the thermostat with a new one.

First make sure your contractor remove the burned or charred items.  This might seem obvious but on many occasions this crucial part is overlooked.  Secondly using water to clean everything might cause more harm than good. Adding water to burned or smoke affected items often times will "lock-in" the burned smell.  To insure that the smoke smell is lessened in severity ask the contractor to use ozonator in the home's environment.  An ozonator emits an oxygen-3 molecule which attaches itself to the carbon molecules that cause that "smokey" smell and renders it neutral.  There are to be no occupants in the home during the ozone's use and the house should not be occupied for 15-30 minutes after the ozone generator is cut off.  To insure that your Contractor is diligently addressing the smoke smell you may want to consult one of the many IICRC (Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration)certified contractors/consultants in your area.  You can reach the IICRC via the Internet at iicrc.org<SEP>how to remove the odor from fire and smoke damage in our home? our son has respitorary problems, and We want to make sure that our contractor is doing all that he can to remove as much odor as possible<EOS>
you could start by replacing the ambient temp sensor located under the hood  gm pn# 16169194<SEP>How do I fix the sensor for the outside temp on my 2001 olds aurora? I murdered a deer after I got my 2001 oldsmobile aroura and when it was repaired the dipslay that used to show the outside temperature did not work. The repair man said the program he used said nothing about it and I asked my other repair guy and he lookd scared to death to get into the computer part of the car (I'm in the middle of montana). So I let it go but then when I went through a car wash it jarred something and it worked for about 2 minutes. So I have looked throught the manual and it says nothing about it, does anyone know where it would be located or how I would fix it, I think it is just a short, something not connected right so if I knew where to look I might be able to fix it. It would be nice to know the outside temp if I could because around here it will snow one minute and be hot enough to swim in a mountain lake the next. Any help is appriciated. thanks!<EOS>
Open the hatch, and look behind where the brake is. If you have to move the carpet out of the way do so.

You can get the joiner at a hardware store, or use a threaded PVC connection that fits the size of the conduit.

I don't quite understand your problem.  If you want to put a shower head directly onto the pipe that comes out of the wall, you should do the following:     1)  Remove anything currently attached to the pipe and any old putty, or tape from the threads that are there.     2)  Put a new band of teflon plumbing tape on the pipe.  It should be installed in a clockwise direction.          3)  Check for a round rubber gasket that fits into the shower head and put it inside the threaded fitting on the shower head.     4)  Hand screw the shower head onto the pipe, then tighten 1/4 to 1/2 turn with a wrench, put a cloth, or tape on the chrome fixture so as not to mar the chrome where you tighten the fitting onto the pipe.     5)  Start the water running, if the connection leaks tighten the shower head fitting very gently until it stops.<SEP>how do I connect shower hose to fixed arm on the wall, or directly to a showerhead that that need an fixed arm I bought an shower head that can only be connected to an arm with the screwthread.

I have more service calls on a disposal than any others. The tools you will need are a sevice wrench, flashlight and a pair of long pliers or hemostats. Shut off the power to the disposal first. Then stick the service wrench in the center of the disposal bottom (there should be a place for it on most). If it doesn't have a place to put the wrench, then the only way to unjam it is with a plunger handle stuck inside of the disposal (with the power off) and scraped along the bottom edge to free the cutting element. Either way, your should be able to use your flashlight and pliers to get whatever is out. If the disposal doesnt work after you clear it out, (doesn't turn) try pressing the reset button on the the bottom of the unit. As disposal is only good for what you scrape off of your plate. If you need to throw away larger quantities, it should be thrown in the trash. This will save you the inconvienince and expense of clooging your pipes or wrecking your disposal. Run lots of cold water as well when running the disposal. I've also had to remove coins, wires and even a few shot glasses from them, keep the cap on when you aren't using it.

You can throw on a new intake and some new pipes out the back.  Improved air flow in and out of the engine will always do the trick.  An aftermarket computer programmer will also take care of the fuel curve, but while it adds more horsepower, you will lose a mile or two per gallon.  They're incredibly easy to use anymore...they just plug into your diagnostic port, which is normally under the dashboard.  If you want even more, you can add a larger bore throttle body.  Again, this will require a bit more fuel so that the ngine doesn't lean out, but your programmer should take that into account and will take care of that.  You could go on forever with upgrades and aftermarket stuff, but they're typically the cheapest and best start.  Check out http://www.summitracing.com/.  you should get yourself one of their catalogs.  I'm almost positive they're free, and it's the best bathroom reading ever printed.

In order to estimate how many shingles you'll need, first you need to estimate  the total square footage of your roof's surface. Just measure the length and width of each plane on the roof, including dormers. Then, multiply length x width to get the square footage of each plane. Simply add the square footage of each of the planes together to derive the total square footage of your roof.EXAMPLE:Plane 1: 120' x 100' = 12,000 sq. ft.Plane 2: 120' x 100' = 12,000 sq. ft.Plane 1 + Plane 2 = 24,000 sq. ft. for the total square footage of the roof.Roof surfaces are measured in "squares." A "square" is an area of roof which measures 100 square feet. To determine the number of squares on the gable roof above, for example, simply divide its total of 24,000 square feet by 100. Which means you will need 240 "squares" of shingles to cover it. The most common type of shingle, called a three-tab or strip shingle, is generally packaged three bundles per square.If this is a new roof, you will also need 240 squares of underlayment (no underlayment is needed if you are applying shingles directly over an existing asphalt roof). Underlayment usually comes in rolls of four squares each, so covering 240 squares would require 60 rolls of underlayment.Good luck!<SEP>how do i measure my roof for shingles?<EOS>

Good idea to wash the engine.

What is a good webapp for finding the best meeting time for a group of people? [closed]<SEP>MeetingWizard meets criteria 1,2,4 and 5.  I think it meets criteria 3 "copy and paste list of email addresses".  An address book is maintained within the application.  Rather than tediously entering each address in the address book, go directly to "Create a meeting request".  Propose one or more dates and times.  On the next "Meeting Event Details" screen, paste your list of email addresses, one address per line or separate with a  comma, to a maximum of 50.  Select the "Add all new addresses to Address Book" box, to eliminate entering the addresses the next time.  I recently implemented this for a local community band.  Many of the musicians are not comfortable using computers, so the two click response without the need for a login was excellent.  The response rate 75%+ greatly exceeded what we were getting with just email.   It has lots of features which came in handy eg reminders to non-responders, adding additional details, printing lists of people attending etc.  The price is great; free.  At one time they had planned a paid version for more than 50 email addresses, but that option does not appear on the website.<EOS>

the clutch idea is two discs with the same material as on your brake pads facing each other.  One is driven by engin.  The other is at the beginning of your gear box.When you depress the clutch pedal you seperate these discs.  This takes pressure off the gears so they can be chaged more easily.Now rub your hands together and gradually push them together, soon they stop sliping.  This is what happens when you take you foot off the clutch pedal.  The motion between the engin and wheels gradually engage.<SEP>how does clutch of a car works?<EOS>
Is there a way to join Google Hangouts without a Google+ account?<SEP>I'm not sure if this is a feature that has been introduced in the year since the question was asked, but it appears that you can use a limited version without a Google+ account via Gmail chat according to this support article :   If you don’t have a Google+ account you can start or join a limited hangout, which only includes the option to hang out with 1 other person. If you’d like access to all Hangouts’ features including the ability to hang out with up to 9 people, share your screen, and use cool Hangouts’ apps, you can upgrade to a free Google+ account   This sounds similar to what Korey has encountered and what Freedom tried to suggest.

Do you have an antique mirror that has silvering beyond redemption or has lost some of its silvering? You can have it resilvered, which is pretty expensive, or you can resilver it yourself, if you can find a kit, which is also pretty expensive and quite dangerous, or you can do it the quick and easy way. If there is just some silvering missing you won't need to remove the rest of it. If there are a few stains along with missing silvering, they add to the character of the piece. But, if you need to remove the old silver you can scrape the old silver off with a razor scraper (be sure it's a safe scraper and not just a razor blade) or remove it chemically. Be sure to dispose of the residue properly, because it will contain mercury and other dangerous elements. Also be sure to wear a dust mask if you scrape the old silver off. Next, you will need an inexpensive piece of 1/8" mirror large enough to put against the back of the original mirror. If the mirror is square or rectanglular the job is done. If the original mirror is shaped, then lay the original mirror on top of the new mirror and trace around the original mirror. If the mark is larger than the original mirror, be sure to remove the original mirror and reduce the size of the marked area so it will fit inside the rabbet of the frame. Next, using a glass cutter remove the excess mirror. If you haven't cut glass before, ask for some scrap pieces where you buy the mirror to practice on. If you aren't too successful with your glass cutting, then have the glass shop cut the shape for you. They will charge a fee which will be considerably less than resilvering or replacing a shaped, beveled mirror.If you are just interested in the process:First the old backing paints must be removed with paint stripper.  Then you remove the old silver with a special silver stripper.  Next the glass is polished with a red rouge.  Then a flux solution is put on the mirror so the new silver will stick to the glass.  Finally you mix the silver chemicals and POUR the silver onto the glass.  The mirror is then dried.  Two backing paints are then put on the back of the mirror and let dry.<SEP>how do you resilver a mirror?<EOS>

chances are if you drilled into a pipe, you'd know it immediately. If you're hanging shelves don't you want to mount them to studs? There are a few things to consider: where your hot water heater is, whether or not your house is multi-story, where on the wall you want to drill. Most reputable plumbers, electricians etc use nail plates, a metal protective plate that fits over where pipe or wire passes through a stud to prevent drywallers or subsequent homeowners from damaging their installations. But for future reference, figure that piping will most always run in the most logical route, from where it enters your house to the furthest outlet. Kitchens, bathrooms etc will usually be designed where they share a common wall. In your case, just because there's a bathroom behind the wall you wish to mount your shelves on doesn't mean the piping is within that wall.  Most times, you'll find the shower/bath, sinks and toilet share a common wall, this is because its simpler to run the piping thus saving costs. If the wall you're drilling into is the same wall your bathroom fixtures are on and/or you have 2  or more stories then use a little care..If they're not then don't worry. Homebuilders take into account this ocurrence and take measures to prevent it. Relax.<SEP>how do i drill a hole in my wall without hitting any water pipes?

Mix some powdered sugar with Twenty Mule Team Borax, about fifty fifty.  The borax kills the roaches.  They ingest it while going agter the sugar.  Using a plastic squeeze bottle like you might find in restaurants, squirt the mixture along all of the baseboards in the house.  If you have a basement, put it on the sills and floor studs, and put all along the edges of the attic, if you have one.  Repeat as needed.  Roaches tend to infest neighboring houses and trees, so you will probably have to retreat the house regularly.  Another thing you can put down is diatomaceous earth, or silica.  This is very effective since they track it back to the nests and it helps kill other roaches too.

If you didn't get the locking nuts when you bought the car then I wouldn't worry very much about it.When you sell a car, the seller buys it "as is".

Otherwise, the only answer you need to tell them is that you DO NOT have the nuts.When you sell a car or anything else, ALWAYS put on the bill of sale  "Buyer accepts item AS IS".

Embed Google Spreadsheet in Google Document<SEP>Here is a script-based solution which allows one to insert a table with the contents from a given range within a given spreadsheet. I did not try to find a way to sync data real-time, as it didn't seem practical given potentially large volume of data that would have to be transferred with every edit to the spreadsheet. Instead, the script adds a custom menu item "update data" to the document.  The script should be bound to the document (i.e., created using Tools > Script Editor in the document menu). The spreadsheet URL, as well as the sheet and range to use, are specified within the script. To embed all the data on the sheet, replace .getRange(rangeName) with .getDataRange() .  When the function updateData is first executed, it appends the table at the end of document. At subsequent runs, it updates the table in place (i.e., if  more text is added after the table, the order will be preserved).  Note that cutting-pasting the table would break the updating process (the script would add a new table at the end) since the pasted copy is a new object. Instead, cut-paste the text around the table.  function onOpen() {   DocumentApp.getUi()              .createMenu('Custom')              .addItem('Update Data', 'updateData')              .addToUi(); }  function updateData() {   var ssUrl = ' spreadsheet url here ';   var sheetName = 'Sheet2';   // name of sheet to use   var rangeName = 'A1:C3';    // range of values to include     var values = SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl(ssUrl)                              .getSheetByName(sheetName)                              .getRange(rangeName)                              .getValues();   var doc = DocumentApp.getActiveDocument();   var body = doc.getBody();   var ranges = doc.getNamedRanges('embeddedSheet-range');   if (ranges.length == 0) {     var table = body.appendTable(values);   }   else {     tableRange = ranges[0];     table = tableRange.getRange().getRangeElements()[0].getElement();     var ind = body.getChildIndex(table);     tableRange.remove();     body.removeChild(table);     table = body.insertTable(ind, values);   }   var rangeBuilder = doc.newRange();   rangeBuilder.addElement(table);   doc.addNamedRange('embeddedSheet-range', rangeBuilder.build()); }  Technical notes   It's also possible to sync the data every hour, in addition to manually. Just add a time-based trigger from Script Editor's Resources menu, so that it runs the function updateData.  One can also adapt this script to be bound to the source spreadsheet instead. This would require changes in how the document is opened (e.g., by URL), but otherwise the logic is the same.  The cumbersome part of the script is getting the handle of the existing table in the document. This requires placing it within a Named Range. Also, it is much more expedient to completely replace the table element than to mess with the entries of an existing table. Since a Named Range is immutable, it is also removed with the table it contains, and then created again, along with the new table.<EOS>

Make sure the stat you purchase is made for your type of system. Many are built for various applications and may need to be programmed for your particular use. First, turn off power to your furnace to insure you do not fry your transformer. Then write down the connections to your old stat before disconnecting them. If you have enough wire, clip off the old ends and restrip the wires so they don't break off when tightening the terminal screws. Connect wires to the same terminals as the old stat. Usually (if you have A/C) the stat terminals will be marked r,w,g,y, and rc or common. There may be additional terminals for a stat that may also be for heat pump applications which would require wiring for a reversing valve. Attach the back plate (subbase) to the wall with appropriate anchors and use a small level before tightening the mounting screws in their slotted holes then simply connect the wires and plug the stat to the backplate. Turn the power back on and you are set to program.There are many different digital stats available. If you know someone in the HVAC business, for about 100 dollars Lennox and Honeywell both make excellent models with simple user interface which you can program from your easy chair then plug to the subbase.Whatever time program settings you use, give 1/2 hour lead time for temp change and do not program night setback more than 8 degrees. It takes more energy to reheat or recool the average home 10 degrees than you would save in energy by setting back. I also reccomend leaving the fan in always on mode when you can. This stops air stratification (uneven temps from flooor to ceiling) and provides maximum filtration. The models I mentioned have a 30% fan on setting to save energy and give better air filtration.If you live in a cold climate a good addition to your system is a duct mounted humidifier. Not only does it alleviate dry air problems such as static, and sinus dryness, you can heat at a lower temperature and still feel comfortableInstalling a new stat is not as difficult as it may sound, I'm sure you can do it, good luck.<SEP>How to replace a thermostat?

On the interior rugs and uphol. again a very light watered down dish or laundry soap for dirt would be OK, use a brush and `rinse` with clear water. The dash and hard plastic parts (tires) maybe just a damp cloth to clean away dirt, and a very light coat of Pledge-type product? After applying wipe with dry clean cloth. It may however attract dust and remain greasy feeling, haven`t tried that one. Overall you would be amazed at what just a damp cloth will clean, and actually just clear water, a rag, elbow grease and a towel can clean a car.<SEP>how to clean a car using household stuff?<EOS>
How does Facebook guess results when you search for someone?<SEP>Here's what I've noticed.  Whenever I search for a friend on facebook, I start to type the person's name, and after the first few letters, I get a list of people who's first or last name starts with the letters I've typed.  NORMALLY, the list of friends starts with people I'm already friends with, and leads into people who I might possibly know through mutual friends.  BUT...  I've recently started dating a guy.  Now, when I type in the letter "G" to search my friend Georgia, the first person on my list is my boyfriend's best friend who's last name begins with "G".  Then I tried "K" for Kelly.  Instead of seeing my friend Kelly who would normally appear, I get a list of people with the last name Keats - my boyfriend's sisters, mother, aunt, and cousins.  I haven't visited any of these profiles before, so I'm guessing that they're all checking out mine to see what the new girl is all about.  That just goes to show that the search results are based, at least in part, on profile visits.<EOS>

Not real sure. But, most fuel pumps are electric and mounted inside the Fuel Tank. You can trance your fuel line to be sure. Jack up the rear of the car and put on Jack Stands so you can look. You are looking for where the fuel line (About 3/8 inch) enters the tank. Most likely you will need to Drain the tank if it full (Heavy). Should be maybe two metal straps holding it on, you will see the Bolts/Nuts to remove to drop the tank and have access to the fuel pump. Be sure this is your problem first, it not hard to do, just sounds hard. You can have someone turn on the key and open the Fill Cap and listen for the pump to run, if it runs and then shuts off it may be good. Check your Fuses and sometimes there a safety shut off that may have got accidentally trip and needs rest, it to keep fuel from pumping if you in a wreck. If, the fuses, Fuel shut-off safety are good and you not see a damaged wire then you ready to drop your tank and replace the fuel pump. Good Luck and be careful. Maybe a friend can help.<SEP>how to change a fuel pump on a 92 geo tracker?<EOS>
I will agree with just about every body's answer.  Most pump on whirlpools are nylon impellers or bronze, which both of them should not produce rust.  If your water heater is rusting out it could be the problem, draining will only last a while.  If you happen to have galvanized pipe of a piece of black pipe in you water system this could cause rust. If you go to other fixtures in your house and get rust out of them it could be that.  It could also be from the water main it self, which is a city or if your on a well a problem at the source.  You might try to put a filter on the water lines going to the whirlpool if if is not the pump or piping on the whirlpool itself causing the rust problem.<SEP>How do i get rid of rust coming out of the air regulator valves in my whirlpool tub? plumbers are all stumped!

I highly recommend doing a brake job when replacing the rotors... but here's how to replace just the rotors:Jack up the car. Take off tire.  The caliper will be mounted with 2 allen cap screws which need to be removed.  Hang the caliper, momentarily, with a wire coat hanger or get a friend to hang onto it.  The brake rotor should pull right off.  (You may need to give it a sharp blow with a hammer.)  Install the new rotor.  Replace the caliper and secure using the allen cap screws.  Reinstall tires.  Repeat for the opposite side.  Try not to move the brake pads when removing the brake calipers.  If you have to pry to get them off take the cover off your brake master cylinder or you might blow it out.  It's easy... you'll be fine.<SEP>how to replace acura cl front brake rotor?<EOS>

When Good Transmissions Go Bad By Heather Madigan & Carolyn MartellCarPrices.com  The word transmission conjures up dread, perhaps even fear. Especially when your mechanic starts to utter, "I think your transmission is . . ." Your brain is attacked violently by the image of your checkbook being sucked empty by a greedy vacuum. The money you had been saving to go on vacation, or to buy that new computer, ultimately will dwindle to nothing now that there is something wrong with your transmission.Instead of having to succumb every ounce of your savings to a mechanic, maybe you can diffuse some transmission problems before they set in. The solution is called preventive maintenance, and it comes highly recommended by manufacturers, dealers, mechanics and generally everybody who has a car or knows about them.The damage done to a transmission can be catastrophic to your lifestyle, at best. For one thing, while your car sits in the shop, you must get a ride wherever you want to go -- Grrr! And then there's that little matter of money: Rebuilding a transmission is estimated at around $2,150. That's some pretty major incentive to try to maintain the transmission as best you can.The basics are a good place to start. The transmission propels the car forward. It is a mechanism that transfers the power produced by the engine, ultimately to spin the wheels of the vehicle. The transmission operates under tremendous heat, therefore it is vital that the fluids are maintained and that extra caution is taken when driving in extreme conditions, such as harsh winter weather or hauling heavy loads. The transmission, however, can overheat by normal driving, pushing the fluid temperatures well beyond safe limits.According to the Automatic Transmission Rebuilds Association, overheating causes 90 percent of all transmission failures. Most of these can be blamed on worn-out fluid that should have been replaced. Check your transmission fluid level regularly, and actually smell it to find out if it has a burnt odor. If it does smell burnt, it needs to be changed. Refer to your car manual to find out specific mileage/time intervals to check and change the fluid, which varies from car to car. Every 30,000 to 50,000 miles is a good number to keep in mind. Performing this sooner will not hurt anything though.If there is a reddish leak under your vehicle, this could spell bad news. It's usually the automatic transmission fluid. It is vital at this point to check the fluid level more frequently. Whatever you do, do not allow that fluid to run low! The transmission will heat up, breaking down the fluid's ability to lubricate and cool. This will increase friction and heat, which will wear out the transmission prematurely. Use the transmission fluid that is recommended in the car manual or printed on the dipstick. Using the wrong type of fluid can affect the way the transmission shifts and feels, causing it to shift too harshly or slip under heavy loads.Getting the vehicle stuck in mud or snow can cause another potential hazard to the transmission -- as well as the whole vehicle, seeing as how it is stuck somewhere. It always is suggested that you dig your vehicle out or get towed vs. the alternative. And at one time or another, we all have seen -- or perhaps resorted to -- the jump-on-the-bumper method to gain traction to rock the vehicle free. This can shock the transmission more than it can handle, and internal parts can start to break.The life of any automobile is extended when it is taken care of properly. So, what if you do change the fluids and keep up on the fluid levels, and it still overheats? Remember, this is a machine and machines break. Do what you can to keep your transmission in good health by performing regularly scheduled maintenance checks. There isn't much more you can do other than hiding the vehicle in the garage, and that's no fun!<SEP>How to tell if your vehicles transmission is bad? I have a 1993 nissan pathfinder<EOS>
Raise front of car and support it on jack stands unless working clearance under car is adequate. Place pan beneath drain plug. Loosen plug with wrench, then remove plug by hand. Let old oil drain into pan. Clean drain plug and washer with rags. Some plugs are magnetized to trap metal particles. he old filter must be loosened with a filter wrench. After loosening, it should be removed carefully by hand so that no oil is spilled. The gasket of the new filter is then lubricated with clean engine oil, and the filter is threaded on by hand. Follow the filter manufacturer's instructions for proper tightening procedures. Replace plug and washer as soon as the oil has drained. Start plug by hand and tighten it as far as possible. When plug is seated, tighten it another half-turn with a wrench. Find oil filler, add amount of oil given in owners manual, 1 quart less if filter is not changed. Start engine and check for leaks at drain plug. Lower car. Check oil level; adjust if necessary.  Then Start your engine up and check for oil leaks. (Note; the engine oil warning light might stay on for a few seconds.) Stop engine and check oil level.And its as simple as THAT! Don't forget your oil filter and of course your new oil!

The clutch will slip, much like an automatic transmission vehicle. The revs will go up but your car won't go anywhere. These clutches are self adjusting, so once it starts to slip, it's time for a new clutch. "Something loose" is too broad to define. What does it sound like? Is it a chirping? Whining?

Try locating the drawings for your home.  We (Florida) are required to keep residential plans on file for 15 years.  Hopefully, your truss engineering would be included in those plans.You can very easily get an opinion from a licensed architect or engineer with your truss engineering.If it was conventionally framed (i.e. 2x6 or 2x8's) then you need the span distance, your first floor construction criteria and your footer design.  Not to knock calling a contractor, but I would run the information by a licensed architect or engineer.  They would have to provide you sealed drawings for your permit anyway. (Sorry, maybe not where you live but in Florida for sure.)I would not do anything with the space if you are unsure.

Use a damp cloth before the stain. This is called "popping the grain" as it allows the stain to penetrate better, because the wood, like a sponge will be more apt to absorb it.

you must shut off the water, turn off your hot water heater, drain all pipes (hard to do on horizontal runs without compressed air), starting at the lowest and going up.  You must open all faucets and flush all toilets.Be aware, if you have galvanized pipes, that you MAY make one problem into TWO..  namely that rust corrosion may break loose during draining and refilling and the loose particles may travel to inconvenient locations like:Shower heads, washer hose screens, faucets aerators, ice cube makers, ad nauseum and ad infinitum..If this is a recent development, then relieving air hammer this way should work..

Remove the #1 spark plug on the drivers side in the front of motor.  With the distributor cap off bump the starter to determine which way the rotor turns.  Clean the timing marks and indicator on the harmonic balancer and timing chain cover.  Make a mark at 8 degrees BTC (before top dead center) or which ever the tag on the vehicle says to time it on.  It will be from 5-10 degrees BTC.  Make another mark on the balancer that is 0 degrees or (Top Dead Center) TDC.  While someone else bumps the starter over, cover the #1 plug hole with your thumb until it blows your finger off.  At this point you want to turn off the ignition switch and turn the engine (by hand) in whichever direction it takes to bring it to TDC or 0 degrees.  On the top of the intake you will find the firing order.  Make a note of this order, and check later on.  Your distributor should be pointing at or just before the number one plug wire on the cap.  This should be with the rotor pointing towards the front of the engine.  If it is out of place you need to remove the distributor, turn it to where its hitting the notch that is before the #1 on the cap.  Remember it wil go down more when it goes into the oil pump.  You can use a long screwdriver to turn the oil pump to where the distributor goes all the way down.  With it all the way down, you should be able to turn the distributor and make the rotor point some on both sides of the #1 on the cap.  If It does not do this, then you need to move to another slot until it will sweep both before and after the #1 on the cap.  This will align your vacuum chamber to where it doesn't hit something when you are done.  Turn the distributor till it is just a few degrees before the #1 on the cap, and the distributor is down all the way in the oil pump.  Put the hold down on, and tighten the bolt to where you can turn the distributor but with a little effort to do so.  Don't forget to put the gasket under the distributor or it will leak oil.  Now check the firing order in the direction the rotor turns.  Starting in the front of the engine toward the headlights on the drivers side, the #1 will be the first one.  The second one on that same side will be #3, and #5 and #7.  From front to back on the other side of the engine it will be #2, and #4, and #6, and #8.  After you have checked the firing order, you are now ready to start the engine.  Have something like a wet blanket or towel handy in case you are out a notch and it backfires through the carburetor, as this can make a fire.  If it doesn't start right away, you are in the wrong notch, and will have to remove the distributor and start over.  Remove the #1 plug, get it on the compression stroke, see if the rotor is point at or just before the #1 plug wire on the cap.  If you have it there then you are in the correct notch.  It is easy to get off one notch and this can be a pain to get right, but you should be able to fire the engine without grinding on it.  I should start right up, and run pretty good.

Locate your head, and you'll see wiring going through to it, unplug those "spark plug wires" and you'll see the spark plugs. Take a spark plug socket (or any socket that could fit) and "unscrew them" replace them. Make sure they are nice and tight and that you plug your wires back in where they should be. I recommend doing one at a time so you don't get your plug wires messed up.<SEP>how do you change spark plugs in a 2001 dodge stratus SE coupe?<EOS>

BPSKI is wrong.  The 98 has two belts regardless if it is a DOHC engine or a SOHC engine.

First of all, remove the seats from the car, and then clean the car normally, by drying it in the sun, or else use a sponge to clean it. Dry your seats as follows before placing them back.1.Use a damp cloth or sponge to rub saddle soap into the leather; work soap into a light lather.2.Wipe away lather and allow to air dry.3.Oil leather with a leather preservative such as mink oil.It is a very delicate job as it can spoil the shade of your leather accessories.

Depends on the mower, but there are two basic ways to do it.  Unplug the spark plug and check under the mower for a small plug going into the bottom of the engine.  That should be the oil drain plug & it normally has a square head.  If thats what you find, loosen the plug a bit, set the mower back down and lift it up on supports high enoght to put a drain pan underneath.  With the pan underneathe, take out the drain plug and the oil will flow into the pan.  After its stopped draining, replace the plug and tighten it snugly, but don't over tighten it.  Refill with new oil and your ready to go.On lawn tractors and some other mowers the plug is located in the engine block or at the end of a sort pipe above the mower deck or engine mount.  In his case, just get a pan in position to catch the oil remove the plug or pipe cap and follow the directions from above.Remember you want to do t=his with the oil warm, but not hot!!

Steps:  1.   Determine that a dead battery is the reason your car is not starting. If the engine cranks when you turn the key, the problem is not the battery and jump-starting won't help. If the windshield wipers, lights and heater blower all work, the battery is probably fine and you may have a bad starter. A jump-start won't help if you have a bad starter. If you hear no sound at all when you turn the key or if the engine cranks very slowly and the accessories do not work, then you have a dead or low battery and it's time to break out the jumper cables. You'll need a flashlight if it's dark outside.    2.   Find someone with a running car that can give yours a jump.    3.   Open the hoods on both cars and determine where the batteries are. Park the booster car (the one that's running) so that the batteries are adjacent.   4.   Turn off the booster car.    5.   Attach the red jumper cable's end to the positive terminal on the dead battery. Use a rag to wipe the battery clean if you can't see the Pos or plus (+) sign on the battery. The positive terminal is always slightly larger than the negative one.    6.   Attach the other end of the red cable to the booster battery's positive terminal.    7.   Attach the black jumper cable's end to the booster battery's negative terminal.    8.   Attach the other end of the black jumper cable to a ground on the dead car's engine; any solid metal part works fine. You may see a small spark when you attach the last end. This is normal.   9.   Turn on the booster car and rev the engine.    10.   Turn on the dead car. If it doesn't start, you may have a poor connection at any of the four cable ends. Jiggle each cable end and try starting the car again.  It may take a bit of letting the car sit while the dead battery builds a small charge.    11.   Once the car starts, disconnect the cables in reverse order of attachment: negative, negative, positive, positive.    12.   Keep the engine running on the jumped car for at least 20 minutes or longer so the alternator has sufficient time to recharge your battery.         Overall Tips:   Always store a set of jumper cables in the trunk of your car.     Holding up jumper cables indicates clearly to passing motorists that you need a jump--but stay safely out of the road when you do so.     When buying jumper cables, choose a set that is at least 8 feet (2.5 m) long; this makes it easier to connect the two cars.       Overall Warnings:   Do not reverse the polarity. Make sure the cables are attached as described, to avoid damaging your car's electrical equipment or causing the battery to explode.<SEP>how do you hook up battery cables?<EOS>
If you are talking about the water line that feeds the refrigerator, I wouldn't suggest changing it to copper, simply because the plastic hose is more flexible and won't crack if bent in the same place repeatedly.If you are set on making the change, make sure that you can do so without pinching or kinking the copper line (this includes when you push your fridge back into place).  The copper fittings are similar to the plastic, as both plastic and copper line make use of compression type fittings.  Make sure to get the same size pipe as the old hose with the proper fittings.  You can get these by asking for assistance at most hardware stores.  You will need a reaming tool to make sure the copper pipe flares at the end and is smooth.  This may also be obtained at most hardware stores.  Then cut to the pipe to the proper length, make sure you have smoothed and flared both ends of your pipe, connect the pipe to the valve and the refrigerator, and make sure to tighten both fittings properly.Not very hard.  Make sure to watch your fittings for a while to make sure you don't have any leaks before pushing your fridge back in place.If you are referring to a different pipe then I would also say "good luck!"<SEP>how do I change the ice maker copper pipe in a refrigerator?

Depends on how the drawer is stuck... If it's stuck from age or swelling, etc. you can try removing the drawers directly below it and to the sides and see if it is open inside to where you can get to the drawer. If so, you might be able to see what's causing the jam or at least where it is. You can try using a small object as a prybar by wedging it behind the drawer and prying outward gently to free it. If there is something in the drawer that is getting caught against the front lip of the cabinet, try using your hand if there is enough clearance or the spatula if not, to pry downward on whatever is causing the jam and slide the drawer out.If you manage to get the drawer free and it is caused by sticking/swelling, rub some paraffin or candle wax along the area where the sticking occurs. It will help next time you face this problem.<SEP>How do I open a stuck drawer? The top middle drawer of my chest of drawers is stuck and I can't open it.

Driving a standard trasmission vehicle takes practice to become profficient. There are several things your mind and body need to learn  to do at the same time or close to the same time. Using first and reverse gears are the most difficult, and down shifting can take a while to get the hang of as well. First you need to get the car moving. This is where first gear is utilized. While slowly letting up on the clutch you will feel a small pressure point in the clutch. This point is where you know to push in the gas just a tad bit and the car (if done correctly) will move forward slowly. It takes getting a full mind and body "feel" of the car, of how the clutch and gas engage each other. While you practice you will jerk a lot and kill the engine. It is getting that combingation of the right clutch release point while giving a bit of gas which starts the car in a forward movement. Once you get the car moving you then shift to second gear. The only gears you need to engage both the gas and clutch at the same time are first and reverse. The other gears can be changed just by pressing in the clutch, changing the gear, letting up on the clutch completely and engaging the gas pedal. Finding the engagement between first, reverse and the proper amount of gas to apply can be difficult at first. Go to a large parking area or a long dirt road and practice. I taught all my kids (8) to drive a standard. We always started with the standard as I feel strongely that once a person masters a standard they will not have any problems with automatics, or trucks, etc. Downshifting is important and can be a bit difficult to master too. Driving a standard requires using much more of your mind and body than an automatic. You have to be aware of the RPMs so you can know when to shift, either up or down. Listening to the vehicle with your mind and feeling how it is responding with your body is required with a standard much more than an automatic. Automatics are easily driven, requires less mental and physical joining with the vehicle and is not as fun. There is more advantages to driving a standard than getting better gas milage or being able to push start it. When driving a standard you can have much more control of the car, and it is simply fun to drive when you are focusing so much of your mind and body with the car. Like I said, just find that point where it feels the clutch has a bit of resistance, slowly press a bit of gas and the car will either go forward, or jerk a lot and then die. As you practice finding that point with the clutch use your whole body to "feel' the car and what it is doing. That is the best advice I can offer anyone who is getting ready to learn to drive a standard. Now, some are just naturals and it comes to them easily, while others have to practive a lot. Do not allow yourself to get discouraged or think you can't do it. Anybody (unless mentally handicapped) can learn to drive a standard. Just remember that even after you have the car functioning and on the regular road you will still require time to get all the proper shifting down pat with further practice. Try downshifting prior to stopping and making the stop as smooth as possible. Also try making your "take off" as smooth as possible as well. By working to make these transistions smooth you will be taking good care of you vehicle. Those who get cocky and refuse to believe they need to learn more finesse in standard transmission minipulation after getting it onto the road are very hard on their vehicles which wears the clutch and other parts more quickly but also put otheers at risk by failing to fully master this type of driving. It is so fun to drive a standard with torc and horse power on a windy road!! It feels like you are one with the car, joined together and it is a blast!! Good luck in learning this type of driving.

Well you have dirt in the line.This does happen alot dont worry.1st remove the sullpy line from the faucet and tuen the water on point the supply line in a bucket flush the line out if it does not shoot water then remove the line from the valve and trun it on then. if the siuuply is a flex line you could run a hanger through it to clean it.See you have no water but you dont know where the water is stopping or jammed up at so if there is water at the valve and through the supply line then the problem is in the faucet.Ill get back to that. If for some reason no or little water from the valve your gonna need to remove the valve and clean or replace, Now back to the faucet.if there is water going to the faucet but none at the faucet  you need to clean out the faucet. if it was lets say a single handle delta faucet you would need a alan wrench and remove the handle then unscrew the top and remove cartdridge and clean. But how you asked your question it seems like you tryed to fix your faucet and didnt get it done correct or found it to hard to do. if this is the case you will need to get a plumber out there to fix it.This is a very common problem in plumbing you shut the valve off to do work and when you turn it back on it wont turn on or off all the way or it kicks up dirt and clogs the line. this happens more so in old houses but it will happen also in new homes.

Depends on what car you are talking about. Every computer controlled car has a different voltage input for the oxygen sensor. The sensor sends a voltage signal and tells the computer if the engine timing needs to be adjusted or not. The eliminator sets this to one constant voltage that tells the computer to advance the timing and leave it there. Thus giving your car better performance and acceleration. But you will need to find what that voltage is at WOT for your car. If you have a car with OBDII system (most 1996 to present cars) then you may can get a programmer to bypass these signals and manually set it to what you want.<SEP>how do you bypass the oxygen sensor?

Easy. Change pads? Disc or rotor. First remove the tire/rim. Sometimes they are stuck on so have a deadblow hammer handy.On rotor brakes the calipers must be removed from the rotors. The pads should pop right out. You may need a C-clamp to push the caliper piston in, so have one of those handy too. Replace the pads just as you found the others.For drum brakes, the drum head must be removed. I have found drum brakes easier to change once you have access to the pads.The only other thing to be done besides changing lines if you have a leak, is to bleed the brakes. You need two people for this.One person behind the wheel, and the person at the wheel well releases the nipple on the caliper. Person at wheel pushes brake to floor. You do this several times until you have good brake pressure. Don't forget to retighten the bleeder nipple you loosened. This gets rid of water and air in the lines.Make sure you have plenty of brake fluid in the resevoir.Not too sure what you meant by repair them.....if this doesn't cover it maybe you can be more specific. If you feel this is over your head, just take it to a mechanic. Changing the brake pads or getting brake service done isn't too expensive.<SEP>How do i repair my car brakes?<EOS>

In a fuel injected car, a small amount of GAS is injected into the piston cylinder. The gas vaporizes instantly and becomes a flammable form. The spark plug 'sparks', which ignites the gasoline vapor. The explosion pushes the piston in the cylinder. The pistons turn the crank shaft which engages the drive mechanisims on a vehicle.<SEP>How does gasoline make the car work?<EOS>

You should be able to prise off the plastic chrome caps which cover the join between the back and base of the seat.  Once removed you should see the bolts which are holding the top sections together - just be careful as there may be springs and cogs etc in there.  Dont think you need special tools - just standard sockets.<SEP>How do I separate the seat back from the seat on a 1978 mercedes. Is there a special tool or trick to do this.<EOS>
First of all, you should know if your ceiling is indeed plaster or sheetrock. Sheetrock would be much easier to remove. Either way, the best way would be to go to your local library and take a book out on Home Improvements.

take a center punch and punch the broken bolt on center. it most likely wont be big enough to get an easy out in it without it snapping off. If that happens you will have to dental burr the broken easy out piece out which sucks.  You will need to find the size of the bolt and what the tap drill size is for it. you can acquire a Garrett card that tells you tap drill sizes for cheap at a hardware store. Get the proper size drill bit and drill it out. then the proper size tap for the whole and re-tap it.  If there is enough of the broken bolt sticking out you may get lucky and be able to grind a flat on two sides and use a wrench or vise-grips.<SEP>how to take out a broken bolt from the crankshaft? i broke a crankshaft bolt froma chrysler cirrus so how do i get it out<EOS>

How can I make some data on a Google Spreadsheet auto-sorting?<SEP>You can use the sort() function for that, but you have to have your data in one place, and an automatically sorted copy of that data in another place.  For example, say I have Sheet1 with my data:  | A    | B    | C =====================  1 | This | this | 2  2 | Is   | is   | 1  3 | Test | test | 3  Then in Sheet2, cell A1, I would put this function:   =sort(Sheet1!A:C, 3, TRUE)   This would show my data, but sorted by column C (the third column), ascending.  | A    | B    | C =====================  1 | Is   | is   | 1  2 | This | this | 2  3 | Test | test | 3<EOS>

While watching the top left or right edge of the door,push the door up until it hits at the top.Notice if there is any gap between the top of the door and the channel (frame).If there is a gap,you will need a long screwdriver (flat blade screwdriver may work,may have to use #3 phillips)to back the screws out and lower the top rollers (in the top of door).Then if you still cannot lift the door up enough so the bottom of the door can clear the bottom track,you will have to back the bottom adjustment screws out so the bottom wheels retract up into the door.It can be a pain,good luck!<SEP>how do you remove a sliding glass door.?<EOS>
