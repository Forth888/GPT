Remove the #1 spark plug on the drivers side in the front of motor.  With the distributor cap off bump the starter to determine which way the rotor turns.  Clean the timing marks and indicator on the harmonic balancer and timing chain cover.  Make a mark at 8 degrees BTC (before top dead center) or which ever the tag on the vehicle says to time it on.  It will be from 5-10 degrees BTC.  Make another mark on the balancer that is 0 degrees or (Top Dead Center) TDC.  While someone else bumps the starter over, cover the #1 plug hole with your thumb until it blows your finger off.  At this point you want to turn off the ignition switch and turn the engine (by hand) in whichever direction it takes to bring it to TDC or 0 degrees.  On the top of the intake you will find the firing order.  Make a note of this order, and check later on.  Your distributor should be pointing at or just before the number one plug wire on the cap.  This should be with the rotor pointing towards the front of the engine.  If it is out of place you need to remove the distributor, turn it to where its hitting the notch that is before the #1 on the cap.  Remember it wil go down more when it goes into the oil pump.  You can use a long screwdriver to turn the oil pump to where the distributor goes all the way down.  With it all the way down, you should be able to turn the distributor and make the rotor point some on both sides of the #1 on the cap.  If It does not do this, then you need to move to another slot until it will sweep both before and after the #1 on the cap.  This will align your vacuum chamber to where it doesn't hit something when you are done.  Turn the distributor till it is just a few degrees before the #1 on the cap, and the distributor is down all the way in the oil pump.  Put the hold down on, and tighten the bolt to where you can turn the distributor but with a little effort to do so.  Don't forget to put the gasket under the distributor or it will leak oil.  Now check the firing order in the direction the rotor turns.  Starting in the front of the engine toward the headlights on the drivers side, the #1 will be the first one.  The second one on that same side will be #3, and #5 and #7.  From front to back on the other side of the engine it will be #2, and #4, and #6, and #8.  After you have checked the firing order, you are now ready to start the engine.  Have something like a wet blanket or towel handy in case you are out a notch and it backfires through the carburetor, as this can make a fire.  If it doesn't start right away, you are in the wrong notch, and will have to remove the distributor and start over.  Remove the #1 plug, get it on the compression stroke, see if the rotor is point at or just before the #1 plug wire on the cap.  If you have it there then you are in the correct notch.  It is easy to get off one notch and this can be a pain to get right, but you should be able to fire the engine without grinding on it.  I should start right up, and run pretty good.  Now use a timing light when you get the engine warmed up to operating temperature and the idle speed at about 750-800 RPM.  Plug the vacuum hose that goes to the distributor, and adjust the timing to spec's, or about 8-10 degrees BTC.  Glad I could help.  Good Luck!!!<SEP>how to time a 73 pontiac 350?<EOS>
Pretty much the same way you drain a gas, oil, propane water tank. There should be a valve at the bottom, it will have a spout with standar threads, the same threads that a standard garden hose uses. connect a gargen hose to the spigget or the valve with the threads, route the hose to where ever you want the water to drain too. Then gently, very very gently open the valve. If you happen to have a water tank with a plastic spigget/valve then you might be screwed. If it's a really old tank the plastic may have dried or rotted to the point it's so weak that an attempt to open it might just snap off the valve completly. If you do have a plastic valve and if it's really old, I would get your friends to help and gather buckets. Average tank size is probably 20 -50 gallons, if the valve snaps and the tank is full then all the contents of the tank will come gushing out. If the valve snaps, it's no biggie to replace it and it's cheap. It's not all that bad, most times it's a breeze but you have to be prepared for the worst.<SEP>how do i drain my electric hot water tank ?<EOS>

1st soak the nut with any penetrate solvent such as WD40, Liquid Wrench or PB Blaster. These are available at any auto parts store. While the nut is soaking with the penetrate tap the nut vibration will allow additional penetrate into the threads to help loosen them.2nd.

most likely, you have lost the ground to the outlet thru the cord or plug. The ground from the motors is doing what it is supposed to do, it is grounding to the frame.

The water level in the bowl is governed by gravity. Slowly pour a bucket of water in your toilet if you don't believe me, the water level will remain the same.

I created a command-line tool to handle this.  After following the setup instructions on the GitHub project, you can run the tool with a specified path prefix and the email address of the new owner:  python transfer.py PATH-PREFIX NEW-OWNER-EMAIL  After getting authorization from OAuth, it will recursively walk the Google Drive account it got authorization to, match against the path prefix (ignoring non-matches), and then transfer ownership to the new email. If the new email address indicates a user who isn't even shared on the item yet, it will handle that as well. The current owner will not lose access, but the new or old owner can revoke it.  I should note that it's not always possible to transfer ownership of an item in Drive. For example, it's not possible to move ownership for an item from G Suite (Google Apps for Work) account to a normal GMail account. It can be shared (which the script will do), but ownership transfer will fail.<SEP>How can I recursively set ownership of Google Drive files and folders?<EOS>

Front Wheel Bearing and Hub ReplacementTools RequiredJ 42129 Wheel Hub Remover (this is a fairly generic tool you can rent from some parts stores - you may or may not need this tool - you won't know for sure until you remove the hub nut as outlined below)Removal ProcedureRaise and support the vehicle.Remove the tire and wheel.Disconnect the wheel speed sensor electrical connector (2), if equipped.  Remove the wheel speed sensor electrical connector from the bracket, if equipped. Remove the front wheel drive shaft nut. Insert a drift or flat-bladed tool into the caliper and rotor to prevent from turning. Remove the brake rotor. (Removing the dront driveshaft nut is going to be the hardest part of the repair.  It is a large nut - 36mm if I remember correctly - and torqued to over 140 ft lbs) Use 3 wheel nuts in order to attach the J 42129 to the wheel bearing/hub.Use the J 42129 in order to push the wheel drive shaft out of the wheel bearing/hub. (often times the drive shaft will push out of the hub with only hand pressure - the older and more rust on it, the more likely you are to need the tool to overcome the rust) Remove and DISCARD the wheel bearing/hub bolts. Remove the J 42129 from the hub. Important: Ensure that the wheel drive shaft outer seal/boot is not damaged. Remove the wheel bearing/hub and splash shield-noting the position of the shield for re-installation. Installation ProcedureInstall the wheel bearing/hub with the splash shield as noted during removal.Caution: These fasteners MUST be replaced with new fasteners anytime they become loose or are removed. Failure to replace these fasteners after they become loose or are removed may cause loss of vehicle control and personal injury.Install NEW wheel bearing/hub bolts. Tighten Tighten the NEW wheel bearing/hub bolts to 130 N·m (96 lb ft).Install the brake rotor and caliper.Install the front wheel drive shaft nut. Insert a drift on a flat-bladed tool into caliper and rotor to prevent the rotor from turning. Tighten Tighten the front wheel drive shaft nut to 160 N·m (118 lb ft).Important: Ensure that the connector clip engages the bracket properly. Install the wheel speed sensor electrical connector to the bracket, if equipped.  Connect the wheel speed sensor electrical connector (2), if equipped. Install the tire and Lower the vehicle.

"The air conditioning system in your car is comprised of a compressor, condenser, expansion valve and evaporator. If you have ever used a can of compressed air to clean computer components, you will know that the bottle gets very cold in a short amount of time. This is due to the rapid expansion of the compressed gas. The same thing happens in your car’s air conditioning system. Refrigerant (AKA Freon) is compressed in the compressor and turns into a hot gas. In the condenser, this hot gas is cooled to a liquid state and travels to the expansion valve. As the Freon goes through the expansion valve it returns to a low-pressure gas and rapidly cools in the evaporator. A fan blows over the evaporator and cools the air that eventually blows out your vents."<SEP>How does a car AC compressor work?If any one know some webs and pictures about it please send me.?<EOS>

Only way to have dirt and crud on the inside of the headlight is if it is cracked and broken and dirt is getting inside.

To push start a bike, you need the key on, the bike in neutral, with a running start, at the right speed, all you have to do is put the bike in 1st gear, release the clutch, and the bike should start.

If you are looking at your gas meter, you should see four dials straight in a row. Pay close attention to the numbers on the dial and the rotation of the pointer. The first dial should be read counterclockwise. Record the number the pointer has just passed. For example, if the pointer is between the number 4 and the number 5, for dial one, the number would be 4 (counterclockwise dial, the number the pointer just passed). The second dial should be read clockwise. Record the number the pointer just passed. For example, if the pointer is between the number five and the number 6, for dial number two, the number would be 5. The third dial is read exactly like the first, counterclockwise and the number the pointer has just passed. The fourth dial is read clockwise, but this time record the number the pointer is nearest. To determine how much gas you have consumed this month, record your meter reading today. Then come back one month from today and record your meter reading again. Then subtract last's months reading from this month's reading to calculate how many ccf's of gas you've used.<SEP>how do you read a natural gas meter?<EOS>

What are the symptoms?  You might just need to clean your bulb sockets.  It also depends on whether you have brake lights that operate as turn signals also or if it has completely separate turn signals.  You could just have bad bulbs.  I've seen all the bulbs go bad before anyone noticed!Some common symptoms on systems with brake and turn signals on the same bulbs:Tail light works OK but goes out when brakes are applied. Tail light will blink dimly when turn signal is used.This is a bad ground.  It could be a dirty bulb socket, or a loose ground wire.  The socket can be cleaned with a piece of sandpaper.  The ground wire will be located near the taillight assembly, bolted to the body.This system also runs the turn signals and brake lights through the turn signal switch.  A bad turn signal switch can mess up the brake lights and the turn signals.  The systems that use a separate brake light system have entirely separate circuits for brake, tail, and turn.  These systems typically have amber turn signals and red brake lights.The dirty socket or bad ground stuff still applies.If none of the lights work you probably have a wiring harness that has been damaged.<SEP>how do i fix the rear passengers tailight panel to make my tailights and brake light work?<EOS>

If you don't want to go to Autozone for your answer. Try these steps:1) Take the rear tire off2) Take the brake calipers off, but leave the brake line fastened. Use a small piece of rope to fasten the caliper away from the work area. 3) Take the brake rotor offYou should see the workings of the parking brake by this time. It is basically like any drum brake system but smaller. Usually, there is no wear on the brake shoes because they are rarely used except for parking. Make sure there is no unusual wear on the shoes. If there is, then replace the brake shoes.If there is a problem with the parking brake, it is usually when the brake is set because the tensioner has loosened ands the shoes aren't closing on the drums. The parking brake uses a cable system that runs through a tensioner that should be located under the car along the drive axel and just ahead of rear transaxel case. The brake shoes should be completly closed when the parking brake is set and completely free when it is released. Adjust accordingly if this is not the case.

Sounds like you are referring to the wheel and not the tire. The tire is the rubber part. Bicycle wheel bearings can be adjusted using tools called cone wrenches. A cone wrench is a very flat wrench that will hold the cone-shaped bearing surface steady while a jam nut is tighted. The cone can be turned to tighten it up so that there is no play, but the wheel still spins easily. Then, using a cone wrench, hold the cone steady while you tighten the jam nut. Not all bearings are adjustable this way. Some may need to be replaced as a unit, which could require pressing the bearing out and pressing a new bearing in. Finally, it should be noted that the bearing is not always the cause for a shaky wheel. It could be that the wheel is not true, and/or is out of round.

there should be an access panel in the trunk. it either flips open on a catch, or there may be screws (but i doubt that last one).Flip open or remove the cover, twist out the socket that holds the brake lite bulb, remove the bulb, replace with new one (only goes in one way, so don't force it in), replace the socket unit, CHECK to see if it works first, then if all is well, close up the panel in the trunk.<SEP>How do you change a brake light bulb in a 1997 Honda Accord?<EOS>

Start by washing the front of the motor with Gunk Engine Brite( http://www.gunk.com/ ) and disconnecting the battery. Drain the radiator. Remove four hoses. Unbolt power-steering pump and fasten it off to the side with a piece of wire. Loosen up the alternator, remove one bolt and pull it aside. Remove the belts. Remove the waterpump. Use 6-point sockets because if you strip a bolthead u r ff'd. Scrape the gasket surface on the engine clean with a square razor blade and scrub it shiny with scotch-brite. Slide the two longest bolts into the new pump and test-fit it. Apply gasket cement to both sides of gasket and according to directions for the type u r using and hang it on the bolts. Bolt it up carefull not to touch the gasket to anything. Snug all the bolts first,then tighten. Reassemble the whole thing. Check and adjust the belt tension. Fill it up and check for leaks. Run it and check for leaks. Run it for 15 mins and check for leaks again.Good luck.<SEP>how do you change water pump on a 1993 cadillac deville?<EOS>

I am a Construction Superintendent and I'm here too help.  First I want to say that there is no such thing as a perfectly built home.  If there was, you couldn't afford it.  With that said, you need to send a punchlist, in writing, certified mail to your builder.  Give the builder a reasonable amount of time to make the repairs.  More than likely, the builder used a Masonry sub-contractor.  Try to find out who that is.If the builder and/or the contractor do not address your issues in reasonable time then you simply go to your town hall and look for the Code Official or Construction Office.  I have seen firsthand, almost immediate results when the Code Officials get involved.  They know all of the builders and they should be able to help out.Most builders allow one year for punchlist items, settling cracks and the like.  Give this a try.<SEP>How do I get the builder to fix problems in my new home that they promised to fix?

Follow your exhaust pipe. It's always in the exhaust pipe. Just follow it from the exhaust manifold back. You'll eventually find it. it will be somewhere inbetween the manifold(s) and the muffler.

You or a mechanic will have to find a loose connection somewhere between the fuse terminal board and the lights.  Since ALL the lights are going out, I would zero in on the wiring and/or the light switch that turns them on.   The best bet on loose connections is to turn the lights on, when it is dark, and begin to wiggle wires.  IF you make them flicker, go on or off, you are close to the problem.  Don't forget to wiggle the fuse and wiring around the fuse panel also.   Good luck.  Pops<SEP>How can I fix dashboard lights that keep going out?

This is more useful for when you specifically want to send it to someone who is not technically inclined (i.e. you want to make it dead-easy to open), which is why I originally posted it as an answer to this question , but it works!   "Add" your .exe file to a (new) encrypted .zip file (the "inner file".)  Change the file extension from .zip to .zipx .  (Of course, other extensions probably work.  You could even make the extension .thepasswordisHuckleberry !)  "Add" the .zipx file to a (new) unencrypted .zip file (the "outer file".)  E-mail the outer (.zip) file along with the password for the inner file.   That's it.  As an added bonus, you don't even have to change the file extension.  Windows File Explorer recognizes the inner (.zipx) file as a valid .zip file, so you can just double-click it and enter the password.  This is what it looks like after opening the outer file and trying to open the inner file.  Note the .zip icon on the .zipx file.  The text file is just there as an example of how you could keep the password conveniently attached to the file, since the point of it is just to get through GMail.<SEP>How can I send a Windows executable via Gmail?<EOS>

GENERAL CLEAN-UP PROCEDURES Identify and correct the moisture source Clean, disinfect, and dry the moldy area Bag and dispose any material that has moldy residues, such as rags, paper, leaves, or debris. What can I save? What should I toss? Substances that are porous and can trap molds, such as paper, rags, wallboard, and rotten wood should be decontaminated and thrown out. Harder materials such as glass, plastic, or metal can be kept after they are cleaned and disinfected. Ultimately, it is critical to remove the source of moisture first, before beginning remedial action, since mold growth will return shortly if an effected area becomes re-wetted. Removal of Moldy Materials After fixing the moisture source and removing excess moisture, the cleanup can begin: Wear gloves when handling moldy materials Remove porous materials (examples: ceiling tiles, sheetrock, carpeting, wood products) Carpeting can be a difficult problem -- drying does not remove the dead spores. If there is heavy mold, disposal of the carpet should be considered Bag and discard the moldy substances Allow the area to dry 2 or 3 days If flooded, remove all sheetrock to at least 12 inches above the high water mark. Visually inspect the wall interior and remove any other intrusive molds. (This step may have to be carried out by a licensed contractor). CAUTION: Spores are easily released when moldy material is dried out. Soap Cleanup Before disinfecting contaminated areas, clean the areas to remove as much of the mold (and food it is growing on) as possible. Wear gloves when doing this cleanup Use a non-ammonia soap or detergent, or a commercial cleaner, in hot water, and scrub the entire area affected by the mold Use a stiff brush or cleaning pad on block walls or uneven surfaces Rinse clean with water. A wet/dry vacuum is handy for this. Disinfect Surfaces Wear gloves when using disinfectants After thorough cleaning and rinsing, disinfect the area with a solution of 10% household bleach (e.g., 1½ cup bleach per gallon of water). Using bleach straight from the bottle will not be more effective Never mix bleach with Ammonia - the fumes are toxic For spraying exterior large areas, a garden hose and nozzle can be used When disinfecting a large structure, make sure the entire surface is wetted (floors, joists, and posts) Avoid excessive amounts of runoff or standing bleach Let disinfecting areas dry naturally overnight -- this extended time is important to kill all the mold. CAUTION: Bleach fumes can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, and damage clothing and shoes. Make sure the working area is ventilated well. Can cleaning up mold be hazardous to my health? Yes. Exposure to mold can occur during the cleaning stage. Mold counts are typically 10 to 1000 times higher than background levels during the cleaning of mold damaged materials. Take steps to protect your health during cleanup: When handling or cleaning moldy materials, consider using a mask or respirator to protect you from breathing airborne spores. Respirators can be purchased from hardware stores; select one for particle removal (sometimes referred to as a N95 or TC-21C particulate respirator). Respirators are not as effective removing bleach fumes, so minimize your exposure when using bleach or other disinfectants. Wear protective clothing that is easily cleaned or discarded Use rubber gloves Try cleaning a small test patch of mold first. If you feel that this adversely affected your health, you should consider paying a licensed contractor or professional to carry out the work Ask family members or bystanders to leave areas when being cleaned. Work over short time spans and rest in a fresh air location. Air your house out well during after the work CAUTION: Never use a gasoline engine indoors (e.g. pressure washer, generator) -- you could expose yourself and your family to carbon monoxide.

Portable generators are noisy. If you have neighbors nearby or the noise is unbearable in your house here are some ideas. - Choose an operating location as far away as possible. Note that a larger gauge wire is needed to reduce voltage drop as line length increases. Reducing line loss is required to minimize power loss and to ensure maximum power is available to the house. Lights will flicker less when heavy loads are attached. - Change the exhaust system. Noise from the portable generator systems comes primarily from two sources, the engine block and the exhaust system.. With an air cooled engine there is little you can do about block noise. Some engines can have a larger muffler attached or make other changes to the exhaust system. Merely mounting exhaust pipe vertically will noticeably reduce noise. - Build a noise shielding enclosure. This could be as simple as a piece of plywood to reflect sound away from the house to a separate shed to hold the generator. Design your enclosure with safety in mind. Provide adequate air circulation and ventilation to prevent heat buildup and to remove carbon monoxide. - If the noise bothers your neighbors, invite them over for coffee or offer to run line to their home to power the freezer or a few lights. Talk to them before starting the engine, ask they let you know if the noise is bothersome before they phone the police or harbor any resentment. A little diplomacy can go a long way. - Last resort, shut off the engine or buy a quiet generator.<SEP>How do iI make a loud generator more quit?<EOS>

I do not know where you live where you can leave the windows open all the time.  I have to assume perhaps the islands.  I live on the ocean and battle the salt daily.  The windows are always closed with the air running.  Just keeping the outside free from rust is enough and almost impossible.Everything that you buy for your home must be stainless steal or aluminum.  Any other metals when exposed to the salt air will corrode.  That is science.  Even my ocean grade hardware is pitted and all power coated aluminum fixtures are pealing.  We replace items constantly and are always washing down the house. Even the landscape gets burned from the salt.Buy only items that will not rust and those that already exist, wash them down as often as possible.<SEP>How do you prevent indoor household items from rusting when you live near the ocean?

to correctly check your pressure tank you must first turn off the breaker/power to well .   Drain the tank by using the closet drain to the pressure tank. We install a water bib on the tank tee for this reason. Once you have drained all water  wiggle tank and see if it still has water in it. If it is heavy with water your bladder has developed a pinhole and the tank needs replaced. If bladder is good all water will leave tank.   NEXT using an airgauge check air in tank , it should be @ 28 lbs if your pressure switch is set to come on at 30lbs  . NEVER should they have 50lbs of air!   If you have a gauge on your tank tee and it is working correctly which they do fail fairly easy . You can find your cut in pressure by turning on power and refilling pressure tank. Once full turn on water somewhere and watch gauge on tee to see where the pressure switch kicks on and calls for water. You want to set your air pressure lower than the cut in pressure by at least 2 lbs. If you have any questions e-mail me and I will answer your questions. DO not listen to the previous answers. They don't have a clue what they are talking about.<SEP>How can you test a well water pressure tank to see if it is working correctly? I have basically no water except for a trickle.

I used to own an old Saturn, and needed to change the side mirror. If I remember right, you first had to remove the panel on the inside of the car. You don't have to remove the whole door panel, just the part covering the mirror attachement. Once you got that off, you need to remove the 3 bolts screwing the mirror in. Then, take off the mirror from the outside. There was a lot of adhesive holding the mirror on, and the remote adjustment stem took some work to pull out.Once the old mirror is taken off, just put in the new one and reverse the steps.<SEP>how do you install a sideview mirror on a saturn SL2?<EOS>

To properly bleed a boiler takes time and Patience. Your boiler should have an auto fill valve to let water in. Hopefully you also have boiler drains on each zone. These drains will have a connection to hook up a garden hose. Direct the garden hose to a drain in the floor, or somewhere that will get rid of the water. Caution, this water is not only hot(180-200 Degrees) but can be very black as well, so choose carefully were you drain to.Turn one of your t-stats up so the zone you are working on comes on, you can feel the hot water by placing your hand on the pipe, again be care full, it is very hot. if the zone is open but not flowing, slowly opening the drain should push the air lock through. do not open or drain the zone to quick, you do not want to let the boiler go dry, bad things happen then. When you feel the hot water come back to the boiler through the pipe you know you have flow. You can hear the air in the pipes as it circulates and open the drain slowly to purge the air out. You need to do this to each and every zone in the system.It is advisable to have an experienced HVAC tech. do this if you are not comfortable, and watch him, ask questions. This is your system, you should know how and why it works. Good luck.<SEP>how do you bleed the boiler?<EOS>

On the vast majority of engines, if the timing belt snaps, say goodbye too your valves, piston, or engine in general.Some cars (very few) have a "FREE RUN" engine. These are so low performance that when the belt breaks, the engine will just stop, because of the valves no longer functioning.HOWEVER, most engines' valves operate close enough to the pistons, with the TIMING of both the only thing keeping them from running into each other.When the belt breaks, the cam stops turning, so the valves stay in whatever position the happen to be in at the time.Because of the crankshaft still trying to turn (think inertia, centrifugal force, etc.) the pistons are still going to move a bit, until the energy in the crankshaft is used up, OR THEY HIT SOMETHING, LIKE AN OPENED VALVE!You WILL either:a)bend a valveb)crack a piston headc)crack a piston (with the broken off pieces scarring up the cylinder wall, remember, the piston will continue to travel a little bit)d)crack a cylinder wall, possibly through the water jackete)all of the above-or-f)none of the above, because ya might get lucky, as even a blind squirrel finds a nut now and then!<SEP>How does Timing Belt affect the Engine?

They said if it breaks, it's going to damage the engine and it will be very very costly...  Any opinion and suggestion out there?  I appreciate if someone can give me a second opinion.  Thanks!<EOS>

First we need to find out if your supply piping is copper or iron. If it is iron the pipes are most likely rusty & corroded inside causing restriction of flow. You can also try changing the aerator (that little screen at the end of the spout) if flow is also slow on the cold water side. Most likely it is the supply pipe as hot water will speed up the corrosion which is why you dont see any slowness on the cold side. If iron pipe the only solution would be to repipe the entire house.

Unless you figure out a way to disable the light, the only way to get it to go away is to have the car hooked up to what is called an OBD II.  All mechanics shops have them.

There are numerous sensors attached to the engine, and if any one of them gives readings that are outside the suggested parameters, the light will come on.

Most cracks in an aluminum head are fairly easy to see with the naked eye, if you have some experience. Your head can't be magnafluxed, it's aluminum and doesn't magnatize. It can be pressure tested to verify no leaks,On your head be aware that although the deck surface may be straight, there may be some warpage in the camshaft area which can cause improper head gasket sealing. It would really be a good idea to have a machine shop re-work the head if you are building the entire motor. They can grind and seat the valves, true surfaces and test for leaks a lot cheaper than a wrong guess may cost you.<SEP>How can i tell if my head on my integra is blown or warped?<EOS>

I assume you mean AC compressor, not air compressor, unless you're driving a constuction vehicle with an air compressor for power tools or something.The "hissing" noise is probably just the vacuum switch inside the dashboard that switches vents on & off, or is controlling outside/inside air intake - perfectly normal.  I'd listen for the engine idle "dipping" breifly, or cooling fans at the condenser turning on, when you turn on the AC.  This should at least tell you if the compressor is getting power.Shops don't charge much just to look at your system and let you kjnow what's wrong with it, then you can make an educated choice as to what to do.<SEP>how do I know whether my air compressor is broken in my car?

You will need to remove probably four screws from around the engine cover.  Pretty much the whole top cover of the motor comes off.  When you flip it over there is a spool that will still have a small piece of your old rope in it.  Just remove the old piece and intall the new cord and handle just like the old one.  You then need to wind up the spool and re-install the cover on the motor.

Wow.  You've gotten some crazy answers on this question.  Cinnamon?   Nutmeg?  Sugar water?  Standing water?   That's nuts.  Literally.Here's what to do.  Truck down to your local Lowe's and pick up a couple different brands of ant spray.  Check the active ingredients and try to get different brands that use different stuff.  You might also pickup a Summer Blend of lawn fertilizer with insert treatment.  Scott's Step #3.  Spray one brand of the ant spray around the outside perimeter of your home, including garage, etc.  Heavier around areas that are damp, door thressholds, etc.  Repeat in about a week with the other brand.Take the other brand and spray afflicted areas indoors including baseboard areas near where ants have been spotted.  Repeat in about a week with the other brand.Put the Scotts stuff down on the lawn with a broadcast spreader.Ants are hardy and persistent creatures that are attracted to food and standing water.  A couple rounds of the sprays ought to do it.  Might need a third week of spray.  Good luck.<SEP>How do i deal with ants that keep coming back!? We have ants that just keep coming back, we have used this stuff that you set out they take the food back to the queen and then it kills them all.

Im A plumber so here is you answer.Its hard to answer You didnt say where it was leaking.A quick run down You have a fill valve/  Douglas Valve/Flapper/Tank to bowl gasket with bolts and a wax ring with or without horn.1st dry off the WC (water closet=Toilet) and try to find out where the water is from2nd if its on the floor then its is the wax ring. Remove the supply line and bolts and replace the wax ring. if its where the bowl and tank meet then its the tank to bowl gasket set (3.99 Home depot) Remove bolts and gasket and replace. TIP when putting the new bolts on use plumbers dope on rubber washers to make a good seal also put Dope on gasket and tank and bowl for good seal. If its from there area where the supply line is going in thats the fill valve. Most WC have a valve with a rod and long ball on the end. DO not replace it with the same one Go to Home depot and Get A fluid master 400a And replace. And supply line check connections if bad then replace.3 other things could be a hair line crack in tank or bowl.also the flapper. inside the WC best way to check use some food coloring from the kitchen put 5 or so drops in the tank stir up a bit in 20 min or so if you used red and the water in the bowl is red then flapper is bad but this could also mean The seal or unit its on is bad. Replace. (this is also a good thing to do at 1st use the color red or blue and where you see it is where the problem is.but last WC= will sweet the temp of the water and the temp outside if there is a certain change it will sweet. You can fix it will a liner in the tank. Home depot again.But with all this info you might have a Kohler 1 PC wc and some of this does not even apply I wish you could have gave some more info on the unit.

First before you take off the belt make sure you have a belt diagram.  If you can't find it in the engine compartment then you have to draw one.  Your 15 minute job can turn into a hour or more if you don't have one.  If you dont know where the tensioner that keeps the belt tight is pull on the belt and look for a pulley that moves.  Get a wrench or rachet depending on what is there to move the pulley.  Just pry the tensioner and slide the belt off a pulley.  I would recommend you to take off the tensioner it is only one bolt.  If it squeeked when moving it replace it while you have it off.  Also look at a new one and compare the pulleys if it looks like it is seperating replace it.  Also spin the pulley.  If it makes any noise replace the pulley.  Also check all other pulleys especially idler pulleys if they make any noises or wiggle some replace them too.Now to put the belt on use you diagram and route the belt accordingly.  Leave a smooth pulley if you can for last.  Take your wrench and pry the tens. and slipe the belt on the last pulley.  Now check to make sure you belt is straight on all pulleys.  One groove off will destroy you belt in minutes.  Maybe have someone bump the engine while you look at the belt and if at 3 times all is ok then start it.  Walaa you done.Hope that helps.By the way I do like soccer.Todd<SEP>how to install drivebelt 1996 cadillac deville?<EOS>

Okay.  First of all you say that the building is "square".  If you are meaning that the roof is perfectly square than you've got the a true peaked hip roof. For this type of roof all you need is the hip measurement.  The mathmatics are considered rise over run.  Rise being the height of your roof and run being 1/2 the width of your roof.  First thing first.  You'll have to decide on a pitch (angle)you want your roof to be. Nprthern homes typically have steeper roofs due to snow loads while southern roofs typically have lower pitches due to higher wind loads.  Once you have your pitch decided, we'll use a 6" over 12" pitch in our example.  If you know that your building is 12 feet wide then 1/2 of that is 6 feet.  This is considered our run.  We will now simple multiply our run (6') by our desired pitch (which just happens to be 6. 6 x 6= 36" or 3 feet.  What this all boils down to is that for every 1 foot of our run our pitch moves up 6 inches.  Next step is using yet more math to discover our lenght of rafters needed.  The pythagiam (excuse the spelling) is the math we will be using.  It's simply wrote as a2 x b2 = c2.  We know what "a" and "b" are.  A=36" and B=6'or 72". Multiply 36 x 36 and you will get 1296.  Multi 72 x 72 and you get 5187.  Add 1296 and 5184 and you get 6480.  Now let's find the square root of 6480 (Good time for a calculator). 80.49 inches.  Roughly thats 80 and 1/2 inches.  This is our rafter length for a common rafter.  For the hips will use the same equations except we will multiply our same run by the number 17 instead of 12.  Additionally the pitch for the hip will be considered 6 over 17.  which means 6 inches of rise for every 17 inches of run.  If this is all to complicated go to Lowes and buy a speed square that comes with a rafter book.  The book will tell you how to measure for your rafters and the speed square will show you the proper angle.Good Luck!!!!<SEP>how do i set out a traditional hip roof? i need to know thw basics of setting out a traditional hipped roof with a hip on each corner of a square building<EOS>

Depends upon the amount of overspray and what type of paint it was in the first place.  Can you flake off the specks w/your fingernail?  If YES, then just take out an old credit card and start lightly scraping it off.  This works for caked on road tar on the rockerpanels behind your tires as well.  I'm not too sure I'd do the paint thinner or any other solvent unless its a last resort (repainting your car is expensive and loses you resale value).  You can afford to lightly scratch the clearcoat surface of your paint as you can buff it out later or have it done.  I would consider taking your car to a detailer or actual bodyshop.

Raise front of car and support it on jack stands unless working clearance under car is adequate. Place pan beneath drain plug. Loosen plug with wrench, then remove plug by hand. Let old oil drain into pan. Clean drain plug and washer with rags. Some plugs are magnetized to trap metal particles. he old filter must be loosened with a filter wrench. After loosening, it should be removed carefully by hand so that no oil is spilled. The gasket of the new filter is then lubricated with clean engine oil, and the filter is threaded on by hand. Follow the filter manufacturer's instructions for proper tightening procedures. Replace plug and washer as soon as the oil has drained. Start plug by hand and tighten it as far as possible. When plug is seated, tighten it another half-turn with a wrench. Find oil filler, add amount of oil given in owners manual, 1 quart less if filter is not changed. Start engine and check for leaks at drain plug. Lower car. Check oil level; adjust if necessary.  Then Start your engine up and check for oil leaks. (Note; the engine oil warning light might stay on for a few seconds.) Stop engine and check oil level.And its as simple as THAT! Don't forget your oil filter and of course your new oil!

Most trailer wiring kits have you use the frame as the ground system. I recommend that you run an extra wire to each of the lights for the ground. The trailer chassis is not reliable when it gets old and weathered.With that said, you need to energize the plug with the vehicle that you plan to hook up to. Check the running lights when the parking lights are on, then the brake lights, then each of the directional signals.Also, your vehicle is not set up with a towing package you may need to change the blinker relay to a heavy duty type. The extra load may cause the directional signal lights to not work properly. They may flicker instead of flash.<SEP>how do you use a lamp tester when wiring a trailer?<EOS>

No clever tricks here. You'll have to remove the roof covering (shingles) by pulling the nails carefully under the exposed part of the shingle. Get a nail bar for this. Remove enough shingles to expose what sheathing needs replacing plus a bit to give you "tool room". Cut out the bad sheathing using a circular saw set to just a tad deeper than the thickness of the sheathing. Cut out the bad stuff as squarely as you can splitting the cut on a rafter so that you have a nailing surface on each end. Replace the sheathing to match, replace the shingles putting a dab of roof cement over each nail and paint everything to match. You may need to replace underlayment and drip edge as well. Work carefully, measure twice, cut once, don't cut nails with your new saw blade, visualize what you want to do and think before you act. The hardest part will be removing and re-installing the shingles. Don't pound on exposed surfaces of the shingles. Keep everything square.Thanks to nailpounder and samhbane :)<SEP>how to repair roof sheathing? The front left corner of the roof has the edges of the sheathing damaged.

Actually, none of these answers do it for me. Your floors are squeaking because you have gaps between your joists and the sub floor.

Do you have access to an electeric hacksaw and a welder.  If so use the hacksaw to cut like a door in the top, pry it up, then with a hammer and chisel(screwdriver) knock the insides to pieces and dump them out.

1. Get the oxygen sensor you need from the parts counter of a Dodge/Chrysler dealership. Emissions problems can be really tough to track down, so for this you want to spend the extra money to get the real thing. Know engine size, transmission type, year, CA emissions or not, high altitude or not, etc. before you go to the dealership, since all these things might cause a different version of the sensor.2. Replace air filter and PCV valve before you put in the O2 sensor. PCV valve should be changed with every oil change. Fresh oil and filter are always a good thing. (Reason? Oil blowby contaminates O2 sensors.) I also replace fuel filter (never gets done) and check fuel pressure, since if these things are poor, the computer may misinterpret them as an O2 sensor. 3. Disconnect the battery. Not strictly necessary, but always good practice, especially since wrenches have a magical way of falling between the starter motor's positive lead and ground. It may also clear the ECM's RAM. 4. With exhaust system warm but not hot, use a combination or deep socket wrench to get off the old O2 sensor. I usually cut the leads off the old one first. Remember you cannot splice an O2 sensor's leads. Use a 6 point socket for better torque, the sensors have a habit of being corroded into place. 5. Apply the anti-seize compound which came with the new sensor. Thread it in by hand and then torque it to specification using an O2 sensor socket and a torque wrench. 6. Plug the new O2 sensor into the harness and reattach the wires to supporting clips. 7. Reattach battery and start up the truck. The truck may behave oddly for a few minutes as the computer re-learns that the feedback system is now working properly and re-enters optimal closed loop mode. (ie. Check Engine light goes out and computer stops throwing diagnostic errors.)8. Re-read fault codes in a week. There should be no new codes. Single-wire (non-heated) O2 sensors are usually cheap enough to get into the habit of changing them every 50,000mi or so - basically every set of tires. O2 sensors get slow in time as deposits cover them. Keep the engine in tune to keep deposits to a minimum. Tune-ups (plugs, leads, cap, rotor, etc.) and fresh O2 sensors will save you gas money.<SEP>How do I change the oxygen sensor in a Dodge Dakota?<EOS>

Well there is no special thing to do on your car versus any other car.  Just take off a plug wire buy twisting the wire as you pull so you won't damage the wire.  Put a socket on the plug and unscrew it.  Make sure you gap it to 52-56 on the plug.  Put some grey anti-seize on the treads and screw them in to 15Nm or about as tight as a oil drain plug.  Also put some dielectical grease on the boots so the boots won't be so hard to remove next time and moisture stays out.  Then go on to the next one.  Just do them one at a time so you don't cross any wires and make sure they don't touch the exhaust.  Keep the wires from touching each other if you can so any spark doesn't just to another wire.  That's all there is to it.Also Jeep Freak has a good point on screwing them in.  The first guy is thinking of a newer mustang.

Do you have an antique mirror that has silvering beyond redemption or has lost some of its silvering? You can have it resilvered, which is pretty expensive, or you can resilver it yourself, if you can find a kit, which is also pretty expensive and quite dangerous, or you can do it the quick and easy way. If there is just some silvering missing you won't need to remove the rest of it. If there are a few stains along with missing silvering, they add to the character of the piece. But, if you need to remove the old silver you can scrape the old silver off with a razor scraper (be sure it's a safe scraper and not just a razor blade) or remove it chemically. Be sure to dispose of the residue properly, because it will contain mercury and other dangerous elements. Also be sure to wear a dust mask if you scrape the old silver off. Next, you will need an inexpensive piece of 1/8" mirror large enough to put against the back of the original mirror. If the mirror is square or rectanglular the job is done. If the original mirror is shaped, then lay the original mirror on top of the new mirror and trace around the original mirror. If the mark is larger than the original mirror, be sure to remove the original mirror and reduce the size of the marked area so it will fit inside the rabbet of the frame. Next, using a glass cutter remove the excess mirror. If you haven't cut glass before, ask for some scrap pieces where you buy the mirror to practice on. If you aren't too successful with your glass cutting, then have the glass shop cut the shape for you. They will charge a fee which will be considerably less than resilvering or replacing a shaped, beveled mirror.If you are just interested in the process:First the old backing paints must be removed with paint stripper.  Then you remove the old silver with a special silver stripper.  Next the glass is polished with a red rouge.  Then a flux solution is put on the mirror so the new silver will stick to the glass.  Finally you mix the silver chemicals and POUR the silver onto the glass.  The mirror is then dried.  Two backing paints are then put on the back of the mirror and let dry.<SEP>how do you resilver a mirror?<EOS>

Park the car and look at it from a distance directly in front and directly behind. If the front left corner is higher or lower than the front right corner, or if the back left corner is higher or lower than the back right corner, it may be time for a new suspension.Remember to take uneven loads out of the car first (no heavy boxes in the passenger seat), and remember that most roads slope slightly toward the curb, so a difference of an inch or two is probably ok.Other ways: If, when you drive over a bad road or railroad tracks or other rough terrain, the car should not "bottom out" (you'll feel it) on its suspension if the car is not excessively loaded.Also, a bad suspension may cause the tires to move out of alignment, and they might start developing unusual tread wear patterns (all wear on the inside half or outside half of the tire, for example), and you'll be able to see it. There are other things that can cause this so this does not automatically point to the suspension.<SEP>How can you tell if you need new shocks or struts?<EOS>

Make sure you are at complete stop before attempting to change the system and also note that the car will use more fuel when in 4x4 mode.<SEP>how do i pout my jeep cherokee into 4 wheel drive?<EOS>
I don't know your specific vehicle, but most cars have screws that hold the instrument panel on. Find the ones that go over your instrument panel, and remove them; they may be covered by plastic molding, so be aggresive when looking for them. Remove the dash, or applicable parts, that would hold the instrument cluster in. If you're replacing the whole tach, them reach behind, and unplug all the wires that plug into it. Can be tricky, as some are held in place by the inlet they plug into. Then pull the whole instrument cluster out by working it around the steering wheel. Now, like I said, I don't know your specific vehicle, so if your tach is stand alone, then just take the tach out. However, if it's like the ones I take out, you're gonna have to take the whole instrument cluster out, find what's failing on your tach, and replace it with parts from a good tach. When I did it, it was a circuit card that I had to replace. I know that was very vague, but I hope it helped somewhat. ps The instrument panel is the part with the tach, speedomoter, fuel gauge, and all the lights.....usually.<SEP>how do i install a tachometer on a 1995 geo prism?<EOS>

Head to Auto Zone or a similar auto parts place. They make a filler that stops the spidering of your windshield, and fills the glass so you can hardly tell it's there. The absolute best thing to do is to replace it, but if you can't afford it at the moment (it's not as expensive as you think) then that will do the trick. It isn't a guaranteed thing, though - sometimes it will be weak in just the right place, and it's inevitable to get a big crack. I wish you luck!<SEP>How can I fix a cracked windshield?

First,since you rent,there may be a clause in your rental agreement that does not allow for these appliances in your apartment.This can be solved by simply asking the landlord of the apartment complex.If this is the case,the point is mute.If this is not the case then have them do the work or have it done by an electrician. The reason I say this is that installing a 220V outlet for a dryer most likely involves more work than you want to do yourself....cutting into the wall,getting wire in the wall,wiring the outlet and the breaker panel,installing a dedicated breaker,repairing the wall,and don't forget the dryer has to be vented,etc..If you are allowed to have a dryer in the apartment,you might try finding a 110V portable unit that you can simply plug into an existing outlet.Hope this helps.<SEP>How do I hook up ap an electric dryer??

I understand your frustration.  I love pigeons and have bred them for many years, but wild ones can be a pain. The plastic owls, etc., have a deterrent effect of about two days, then the birds get used to them and perch on them pretty much.  If there is no way that you can physically keep the birds out, then I would suggest another possible idea.  Go to a kite store.  Specialty kite shops often have what I call "flapping wing bird" kites. Some of these are designed to look like hawks, gulls, etc.  Get a couple of the hawk ones and post them onto stakes, etc., or from a ceiling, etc., so that they can "fly"They need to be able to "fly" intermittently, either in a natural breeze or perhaps in a fan.  I've suggested this method to a few people in the past and it's seemed to have worked.   The sudden flapping of a "predator" spooks the pigeons and if it happens often enough (without any sort of schedule that they can get used to), they usually decide the "fear" isn't worth it and go somewhere else.Now having said that, I hope you've also closed off places where they may be nesting, etc., so they don't have any urge to come back again.Good luck -- and at some point when you see others suggesting this and charging for it down the road, remember I said it first :-)<SEP>how to drive away the pigeons from my factory shed? they create lot of problem thro their droppings. tried many ways to drive them out. could not sucseed. has any one experienced this. how you are sucessful?<EOS>

Set your multimeter to read AC Volts at a range which will work for 120 V. I assume you have already done this.Determine that you have a ground, sometimes the box is grounded, a waterpipe or you may need to get an extra length of wire to connect to a ground and get it to the outlet you are working on.Next measure the voltage from one side of the outlet to ground:If you have 120V this is your hot lead.If you have 0V this is your neutral or non power lead.Take care not to get across the circut with any part of your body.

In every vehicle there are 2 parts to the cooling system. Whats in the radiator and whats in the engine block. The thermostat sits between them. when you start you car your engine warms up and the coolant in the engine block gets hot. when it reaches the right temperature the thermostat starts to open allowing some of the cold water from the radiator to circulate round the engine. That's how the system works. So for a really simple test, start your car from cold and wait 10 minutes. If the top of the radiator is hot then you know that the coolant is circulating and your thermostat works. If its cold then you have a problem.

well if the engine runs and you want to set the timing then you will need a timing light, first connect your timing light to the battery and the number one spark plug wire, clean off your timing marks on the harmonic balancer and timing indicator and outline with chalk or something that is visible this is just  a suggestion and is not required, loosen the distributor clamp about a quarter turn and then start the engine, point your timing light at the marks and see where the lines are on the balancer and your indicator, I do not know the specification on your car but 0 degrees or slightly advanced is generally a good starting point. If your car backfires or when the starter engages and the engine turns over real slow then that is a good indication that your timing is off or a fault somewhere in the ignition system.<SEP>how to set timming on a 1979 nova V6?<EOS>

First, if you ran out of oil it is possible you MAY have drawn some sludge into the line and clogged the orifice (nozzle) in the burner. It must be cleaned or replaced. Unless you're a good mechanic AND you know what you're doing let a serviceman do it.MORE  LIKELY,  if you did draw sludge from your tank into the supply line it may very well have 'gummed up' the in-line filter (if you have one) - most systems do. You MAY have to replace the filter element and,  if you do replace it,  fill the canister and filter assembly with fuel oil before reassembling it. This is the best way to prime the line and it saves a lot of bleeding time and by not having the canister filled you may not be able to completely bleed the system. Sounds like either a clogged filter (most likely) or a clogged nozzle(orifice) or BOTH!  One other thing - if you know when your oil deliveries are scheduled make an effort to have someone home and have them turn off the emergency shut-off switch (usually a red wallplate) prior to the delivery. Leave it off for 2 hours or so before turning it back on. The reason? When oil is pumped into the tank it stirs up the 'gunk and junk' which has settled to the bottom of the tank and this 'stuff' stays suspended in the oil for some time after the delivery. By not running the oil burner for several hours you give the 'gunk' a chance to settle back to the bottom of the tank and not be pulled into the supply line where it does its dirty deeds.Good luck!<SEP>how do i prime my oil burner/furnace? i recently ran out of oil in my oil burner/furnace, and now that the thing is full again it won't turn back on. i've already tried bleeding the thing and that doesn't work. where i live it is very cold and i need help fast!!!<EOS>

In order to gain access to the spark plugs on a 2000 Alero, you must remove the cover on top of the engine that has the engine size.

At the pool I work at, some well-meaning parent shoved a pressure washer into a closet and stored it on its side.

Inspection of the airfilter showed that it was covered in what appeared to be motor oil (from crankcase breather tube maybe?) and the engine wouldn't start, it would turn over, but not start.  There is still enough oil in the engine and fuel as well, plus the oil in and around the air filter also got all over the carburetor and choke plate, so that probably is a problem too.  If anyone knows what to do to get it up and running again, the help would be much appreciated.<EOS>

My husband used to be a trash man, and he said that if you put cat litter or sawdust in the cans to dry them up you can then stick them in black trashbags and put them at the curb.  The reason they won't take them is that paint, paint thinner, and varnish has a tendency to set the back of the truck on fire (happens more than you'd think).  It's also a danger to the driver if the cans are punctured and they breathe it in.

Make sure the stat you purchase is made for your type of system. Many are built for various applications and may need to be programmed for your particular use. First, turn off power to your furnace to insure you do not fry your transformer. Then write down the connections to your old stat before disconnecting them. If you have enough wire, clip off the old ends and restrip the wires so they don't break off when tightening the terminal screws. Connect wires to the same terminals as the old stat. Usually (if you have A/C) the stat terminals will be marked r,w,g,y, and rc or common. There may be additional terminals for a stat that may also be for heat pump applications which would require wiring for a reversing valve. Attach the back plate (subbase) to the wall with appropriate anchors and use a small level before tightening the mounting screws in their slotted holes then simply connect the wires and plug the stat to the backplate. Turn the power back on and you are set to program.There are many different digital stats available. If you know someone in the HVAC business, for about 100 dollars Lennox and Honeywell both make excellent models with simple user interface which you can program from your easy chair then plug to the subbase.Whatever time program settings you use, give 1/2 hour lead time for temp change and do not program night setback more than 8 degrees. It takes more energy to reheat or recool the average home 10 degrees than you would save in energy by setting back. I also reccomend leaving the fan in always on mode when you can. This stops air stratification (uneven temps from flooor to ceiling) and provides maximum filtration. The models I mentioned have a 30% fan on setting to save energy and give better air filtration.If you live in a cold climate a good addition to your system is a duct mounted humidifier. Not only does it alleviate dry air problems such as static, and sinus dryness, you can heat at a lower temperature and still feel comfortableInstalling a new stat is not as difficult as it may sound, I'm sure you can do it, good luck.<SEP>How to replace a thermostat?

turn the pump off, relieve water pressure (open faucets)remove line from pump inlet, remove the line from the well, remove old foot valve, save yourself some work by buying the same size, put plumbing tape on end of line, replace new foot valve. (make sure not to over tighten) prime pump, get air out of lines past the pump (open faucets again) good to go. Good luck to you. Sounds like alot but actually rather simple job.

High voltage electricity (anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 volts) is supplied to the to the spark plug by the ignition system.  The spark plug has an insulated passageway for this high voltage to travel to the electrode, where it can jump the gap and create a spark,  similar to a bolt of lightning. This ignites the compressed fuel/air mixture, causing the expanding gases to force the piston down. This process converts the chemical energy stored in the fuel to mechanical energy.<SEP>How does spark plug works?<EOS>
1. Inspect the black rubber cover that fits in the disposal. Sometimes bits of garbage collect under the flaps and create a smell.    2. Clean the rubber cover, if necessary. If yours lifts out, remove it and clean away debris with a scrub brush and warm, soapy water. If your rubber cover is installed permanently, lift up each flap and clean it with soapy water and an old toothbrush.    3. Deodorize the disposal.

The reason ice dams form is because there is heat getting into your attic. This melts the snow on your roof which re-freezes when it gets down to the colder eaves. This can cause leaks as the ice can actually back up under the shingles. You need a good insulation blanket on the floor of your attic or, if insulating the rafters, make sure to install styrofoam baffles that will allow cold air to circulate between the roof sheathing and insulation. Ideally, you only want the snow to melt because it's warm outside, not because your attic is warm, this reduces the chance of a re-freeze at the eaves.A tell tale sign of poor attic insulation is when you look at a roof and can see the rafter lines because they're still covered in snow while the spaces between the rafters has melted.<SEP>how do i stop icicles & ice buildup on the edge of my house roof?<EOS>

if you want factory wiring along with your new aftermarket radio, then you need wiring harness adapter that go along with the type of stero you got.  that way you dont have to cut into any wire which you have no clue of.  that would be the easliest way to get it done.  if you prefer to save some money without buying the adapter, then you need to cut into the factory wiring.  for that 1st need to know which wires are for power. 2nd which are for speakers.  most people think power is usually red but can be different or a mixture of different colors. instead of assume which wire is which.  do it with a multimeter, that would help without burning the fuses.  identify which are speaker wires.  move them aside, you are left with power, ground, antennna etc.  to find the power that mean +12vdc, hook up the meter with black probe touching the chasis or the car.  with key on engine off, the red probe of the meter would be use to test out which is the hot wire.  you would go through the few wires until you know which one is which is +12vdc.  once you get power, ground, antenna figure out, then everything else is easy.  hope that helps<SEP>how to install an aftermarket radio in a 1997 ford taurus sho?<EOS>
If you are talking about plumbing pipes you shouldn't be able to smell them because there is supposed to be a trap in all drains which keeps water in it at all times unless it hasn't been used in a long time and the water has evaporated.There is supposed to be a vent on all drains and the water in the trap makes the sewer gas and odor go up the vent instead of into the house.If you have drains that haven't been used in a while run some water in them.If this doesn't work and you have a garbage disposal then that is probably where the odor is coming from.I personally don't like them,mainly because of odor problems and they can help to clog your pipes.<SEP>how do i fix smelly pipes?<EOS>

Here's How:1.   Wear rubber gloves and eye protection while cleaning cast iron since the methods require using caustic chemicals.2.   Begin by spraying the pan with oven cleaner and putting it in a plastic bag.3.   After a day or two, take it out of the bag and scrub it down with a brass brush.4.   If all the grease doesn't loosen up right away, repeat the process concentrating cleaner on stubborn spots.5.   If you have several dirty items, soak them in a solution of one and a half gallons of water to one can of lye mixed in a plastic container.6.   Allow them to soak for about five days, then remove the pieces and use the same brass brush method to scrub them clean.7.   Removing mild rust should be done with a fine wire wheel on an electric drill.8.   Crusted rust can be dissolved by soaking the piece in a 50 percent solution of white vinegar and water for a few hours.9.   Once the pan's clean, begin the seasoning process by warming it in the oven for a few minutes then applying a little shortenting, vegetable cooking spray, lard or bacon fat.10.   Put the skillet back into a 225 degree oven for 30 minutes. Remove and wipe it almost dry to eliminate any pooled grease.11.   Place the pan in the oven for another half hour or so, completing the initial seasoning.12.   The seasoning process will continue with use, especially if you use it to cook fatty foods (bacon, sausage, fried foods, etc.) the first few times it hits the stove.13.   To clean after cooking, boil hot water in the pan. Let it soak for several minutes and then wipe dry with a paper towel.14.   Reheat the pan and apply just enough grease to wet the surface before storing.Tips:Use the methods above only for cleaning iron.Don't soak pans in a vinegar solution more than overnight without checking them because the solution will eventually eat the iron.After cooking, do not use detergent or scouring pads to clean a cast iron pan since this will destroy the seasoning.What You Need:Rubber glovesEye protectionSpray oven cleanerLarge plastic zip bagBrass brush<SEP>how do you remove baked on grease from a cast iron skillet, and  what is the best way to maintain?<EOS>

Let's start with the basics...first of all are you positive you are referring to a manual transmission?  If so, then the answer is easy.  If not, read the owner's manual.  For an automatic transmission, park the vehicle on a level surface and engage the parking brake.  Start the engine and allow to warm up to normal operating temperature.  Raise the hood and look for the brightly colored dip stick near the firewall.  The transmission should be in park when checking fluid.   Also check the color and smell of the fluid.  Dark red to almost black is an indication of trouble and a burnt smell is another indication of problems.Now for the manual transmission.  There should be a small pipe-type plug on the side of the gear case.  Simply remove the plug.  If no oil runs out, add oil until it does.  When full, replace the plug.  Check the owner's manual for the correct lubricant, but I think I used to use the heavy rear-end oil (about 80wt).  Good luck.<SEP>How do you check standard transmission fluid levels?

My prob is that i tried to pull it out and it would not budge.  I've tried to use a prybar, but I could only get the bell housing, toward the front of the car to open up about a half an inch.  It seems to be sticking around the locating pin area, but i have found no bolts I could have missed.  Am I missing somthing here or what?

If you are looking for the combination for the keyless entry system, there are several ways to get it! Ford put the combination on a small white sticker, and that is usually found on the trunk hinge, or on the rear hatch. It will be a 5 digit number, and have no identification on the sticker other than the number. The code is also on the control module that is located in the drivers door, but that will involve taking the door panel off.Any Ford / LM dealer can read the code with a scan tool, but they may charge you to do so!<SEP>How do i get da key pad code to my 1997 Ford or does anybody know the 1.800 company number so i can get it?<EOS>

The best boxes to move with are 24-ct longneck beer boxes. In San Antonio there are plenty of those, party on!Go to the bars and clubs, groc store (if not a dry county like mine), and liquor stores. They are free, can't beat that with a stick. May be in high demand at certain times...my guess is end of the month or first couple days of the month when people are getting evicted.They are a nice size, they have handles and flip top lids, and they are STURDY. And if you have small fragile items they may fit in the divided sections in there otherwise the grid can come out.If you can't get beer boxes any other liquor box will be nice and strong.

No one can guarantee that it won't crack again. If your house is still settling, it will most likely crack again.To repair:Go to Home Depot, or Lowes, or other hardware store and get some pre-mixed joint compound, some mesh drywall tape, and a 6-inch taping knife.Tape the mesh tape over the crack until you have the entire crack covered with the mesh tape.Use the taping knife and spread the joint compound over the mesh tape and crack. Try to squeeze the joint compound through the mesh tape so that it fills up the crack. Use the taping knife to smooth out the joint compound on the wall.Let it dry overnight.<SEP>How do I mend seams in the drywall of my home with the reassurance they won't crack again?<EOS>
With the release of the Data Export feature , you can now   Go to your board  Click the "Board Menu" button (on the right-hand-side of the screen)  Select "Share, Print, and Export"  Click "JSON"   This will download a copy of your board data.  Pro tips:   You can also just add .json (or /somename.json) to the end of a board or card URL, to get the prompt to save the downloaded file  (e.g. https://trello.com/board/welcome-board/4e6a8095efa69909ba007382/somename.json )  Alternatively, instead of clicking on the "JSON" button, you can right-click on it, and copy the URL  If you have lots of boards that you want to download regularly, you'll have to save all the JSON links somewhere for all your boards, and download each one individually.  Changing the names of all these individual files for each set of backups could get a little tedious, so one idea would be to create a new folder each time you backup your boards, and then save a set of exported files into that folder.<SEP>Is it possible to export my data from Trello, to back it up?<EOS>
the windshield in a car is actually two pieces of glass with a layer of polimer in the middle to keep the shield from breaking in large pieces in case of impact. This makes it harder to control the temperature of the glass on the outside as well as the inside. Fog ,during rain,on the inside only indicates the shield is a different temperature on the outside. The automotive industry uses defrosters to control the temperature of the glass thus giving a clearer view threw the glass. My advice would be to find out why the defroster wasnt giving me the proper results. If you choose to use a chemical, then rain-x  is about the best and can be used both on the inside of the shield and the outside. Rain-x can be found  at any walmart store and will be cheaper there rather than an auto parts store.      good luck<SEP>How to keep the inside of my car windshield from fogging up?

You sure you want sway bars? There are better forms of suspension...coil springs don`t have the same "give"...I like them better..the ride seems smoother.

If you are trying to erase the memory in your car's computer, there should be a fuse in the fuseblock labeled "ecm" or something close. If you pull this out, and leave it out for a short time, it will reset computer memory. If you have a check engine light on that you are tired of seeing, I don't know of any fuses that will shut this off. Your options are:1: Place a piece of tape over the light.2: Take out the instrument panel and remove the bulb from the check engine light(Note: this may be viewed as tampering with an emission control device in some areas)or3) Getting the condition that caused the light to come on repaired.<SEP>how do you pull the fuse to your check engine light? where is it located, etc?<EOS>

Subsurface leak detection equipment.  U can't go by where the water shows up.  It seeks the past of least resistance & can show up 50' from the leak.  When I locate leaks I use an air compressor hooked to the boiler drain to the washer or the outside hosebib.  The air is easier to hear than water.  Sometimes if you put your ear to tha slab you can hear the air gurgling coming out of the pipe. You can also drill a 3/8" hole where you hear it best and when your over it the air will blow out of the hole pretty hard. I have equipment that makes this easy though.  It runs around 250 for a slab leak specialist/plumber to find it for you.

Pressure regulators are factory set for 50 psi. You can increase the pressure by backing off the lock nut, then turning the screw in. You should really to a pressure test on an outside line first to determine if you have enough pressure coming from the meter. Look to see if there is a tee in the incoming water line before the water shutoff and regulator. If there is, that line is going to a hose bib ( spigot ) to the outside of the house. That will give you a real pressure reading from the meter. Pressure testers are available at Home Depot, etc. and just attach to the spigot like a hose. Turn on the water and get the reading. If you can change the water pressure be careful . If you have a spigot at some other location around the house, it will be the water pressure after the regulator. Check it as you increase the pressure. I wouldn't go above 65 or 70 psi. If that doesn't do it, your water pressure in the lines isn't the problem.<SEP>How can you increase water pressure in a house?

If the battery is showing fully charged from the charger but runs out quickly or does not charge at all, I would suspect a bad battery.  Take a multimeter and read voltage (Make sure the meter is set to DC!).  No matter the charge on the battery the voltage should remain the same... to check the charger, put the battery in series with the charger/meter( this time turn the meter to Ampere setting 10A max first - if you get nothing, then you can adjust to the mA setting) and you should get a corresponding reading to the manufactures specs.NiCd (Nickle Cadnium) and Li-Ion (Lithium Ion) have dissimilar characteristics on charging rituals...e.g.  NiCads like to be FULLY discharged before recharging - this lengthens the life of the battery while if you truly discharge a Li-Ion, you'll probably never be able to use it again.Also, schwinn products might be sold at walmart.  Or where ever you may purchase another battery save the receipt, and take the bad one back.good luck<SEP>how do i fix my schwinn scooter it says its charged and does not charge?<EOS>

If the flooring is new and not worn then you may have soap build up which can dull hard floor finishes.  Mopping is fine only if you are using a wood floor mop.  They can be found in any hardware store, Wal-mart etc.  They are a flat version of a mop and use less water.  you should never use excess water on wood floors.  I have seen many wood floors damaged this way.  You could try to rinse with just plain water to remove build up or use water with some white vinegar (vinegar is acidic and an effective way to rinse soap build up & a good home remedy) you can also buy a store bought rinsing agent which would be a higher grade acidic cleaner.  If your floor is dull due to wear there are some products you can buy off the shelf to restore wood floors that are inexpensive but they are really just short term solutions, they usualy are a wax of some kind.  The best way to get the shine back of a worn wood floor is to sand and re-finish.  Which is best left to a pro unless you are very handy (then you can rent everything nessesary at most hardware stores).As for on going maintenance for hard floors, do not use excess soap and only use a neutral soap, better yet clean often using only water or very little soap.  Using the wood floor mop and not too much water.  If possible sweep or vacuum the floor before mopping.<SEP>How do i maintain, clean and manage my parquay flooring??? the parquay in my new house has lost some of its shine of late. is mopping good for this kind of flooring?<EOS>
