There's a few things you can try:1. Buy the CLR or something similar, that might take care of it2. Use 2 bottles of Coca Cola - yes, Coca Cola. My husband is a cop and they always have Coca Cola in their trunk. This stuff cleans up everything, grease/oil, blood, rust, etc etc.  I guess the acid in the Coke eats away on pretty much anything.3. My dad used to take some concrete powder, sprinkle it on the stain and just brush it in with a broom. I don't think it made the stain go away, but it made it fade out enough to where it was hardly recognizable.Anyhow, good luck with the oil stain :-)<SEP>How can I get a motor oil stain from a brick block driveway?<EOS>

If you live in a council or h/a house or receive benefits, pest control from your local council will come out for free. I'm not sure what they charge otherwise. When I had them there wasn't much of a body count to be honest and the guy from pest control said that's normal enough cos they take the poison back to their nest and they all die there. Are you sure they are still alive? I'd carry on putting the poison down cos they are taking it and it will eventually kill them. Traps are useful too. Or even get a cat or dog - tho that's a bit drastic if you don't want a pet! Good luck I know how horrible it is but they will die in the end. Carry on doing what you're doing.

Jene is correct – “If you can feel the scratch with your finger nail it is too deep to be buffed out” An alternative to a regular body shop is a mobile service called AERO-COLOURS. New car dealers use AERO-COLOURS (or one of it’s competitors) to airbrush paint touch-up on used cars. AERO-COLOURS repairs are invisible and should cost $75 to $200. Check your local Yellow Pages or New Car Dealer to find a local AERO-COLOURS.<SEP>How can I get a deep stratch (made by someone's key) off on my car?<EOS>
How to set up Gmail to show more than 20 results per page when searching?<SEP>Note: @Joe has created a JavaScript bookmarklet which automates the process described below. It is available at joereddington.com->better-gmail-search .  I discovered this slightly more friendly hack after noticing the URL of the inbox: unread first . After expanding the unread section, you'll notice in the location bar there's a #section_query . With the exception of that one part, it's practically the same as a search result URL.  So, the solution is to first input the search terms and search. Then, in the address bar, replace #search with #section_query .  This will provide you with a search page with the same amount of pages as specified in your settings, without the hassle of creating a filter.<EOS>

I don't know your specific vehicle, but most cars have screws that hold the instrument panel on. Find the ones that go over your instrument panel, and remove them; they may be covered by plastic molding, so be aggresive when looking for them. Remove the dash, or applicable parts, that would hold the instrument cluster in. If you're replacing the whole tach, them reach behind, and unplug all the wires that plug into it. Can be tricky, as some are held in place by the inlet they plug into. Then pull the whole instrument cluster out by working it around the steering wheel. Now, like I said, I don't know your specific vehicle, so if your tach is stand alone, then just take the tach out. However, if it's like the ones I take out, you're gonna have to take the whole instrument cluster out, find what's failing on your tach, and replace it with parts from a good tach. When I did it, it was a circuit card that I had to replace. I know that was very vague, but I hope it helped somewhat. ps The instrument panel is the part with the tach, speedomoter, fuel gauge, and all the lights.....usually.<SEP>how do i install a tachometer on a 1995 geo prism?<EOS>

I have to agree with the other posters.  If you want an accurate assessment you will need to call an appraiser.  A Realtor can give you an idea of what similar homes in your area have recently sold for or are currently listed at.  The websites out there are just crap.  They use loan info to give you a value.  My house was bought with cash,  one website (zillow) values it with the foreclosure amount of the previous owner from 2 years ago (nothing to do with current market conditions) and the same website shows our neighbors house (paid 1/2 cash and financed 1/2) for the amount financed as the value of the home.  Another website shows my house being 30 years older than it actually is, bringing the value down.  None of the websites have the square footage correct.  My advice to you would be to have an appraisal done ($200-400) or to call a Realtor.<SEP>how do i determine the value of my house? - 20318 larkmoor drive, Southfield, MI 48076- Ranch, brick, 3 bed, 1.5 bath, 2 car garage, full finished basement<EOS>

With just retiring one of these with nearly 200K miles, I experienced similar problem.  It was the coil.  It would start, idle rough, then die.  I would check the distributor cap and the rotor button as well.  None of these parts exceed 20.00 at Autozone.I would also check the timing and timing belt.  You can remove, I believe, 9 10mm bolts from the cover on the left side of the engine and expose the belt.  Make sure it is in tact.  If it is, pull that cover all the way out.  You will find a indentation in the top gear(camshaft gear).  That should be pointing at the 12:00 o'clock position while the notch in the lower gear(crankshaft gear) should be in the 12:00 o'clock position.<SEP>how do you fix a 1990 geo storm when it acts like it wants to start but doesnt? we had it started but died.?<EOS>

How can I export my Google chat logs?<SEP>I have figured out a way to get them out via forwarding them, using a browser scripting tool call iMacros.  I think this macro will only work with Firefox 3.6 which you can get from this link .  I wont go into installing and setting either of them up, but here is the macro I used.  VERSION BUILD=7300701 RECORDER=FX TAB T=1 FRAME F=4 TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:hE&&TXT:Reply WAIT SECONDS=.5 TAG POS=1 TYPE=TEXTAREA FORM=NAME:NoFormName ATTR=NAME:to CONTENT=test@GMAIL.COM TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TABINDEX:1&&ROLE:button&&TXT:Send WAIT SECONDS=3 TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG ATTR=ALT:&&SRC:images/cleardot.gif&&CLASS:iHkD0e&&TXT: WAIT SECONDS=2  Just replace 'test@gmail.com' with the email address you want to forward to.  Now the only other key piece of advice is where to start the loop of the macro.  To do it right, you will want to create a label and assign all your gmail chats to it.  This will allow you to see your chats in chronological order and forward them that way.  Then in gmail click on the label, when the list opens it will likely open to the newest first.  Therefore, go the the last page of the labels contents.  Open the last item.  here is when you click "play loop" in iMacros.  I had 1k chats to export.  You'll notice there are "wait" statements in the code, this will give the browser time to keep up. They may need tweaking.  Also, check back every couple of minutes, because it sometimes throws an error, or tries to move to the next (newer) chat before the email has been sent.  Just click "cancel" and it will go back to the script and the email will have been sent.  If it throws any other errors during operation, you should be able to adjust the loop duration and start it again with no problems.  This has been aggravating me for so long since I switched Gmail accounts due to spam, so I am finally happy to close that account having got all my content out.<EOS>

Strobe Lights can be purchased at many auto parts locations.  They are however, illegal to operate while the vehicle is in motion.  Impersonating an emergency vehicle.  To install one, you need to put it someplace where it won't get wet.  Most of them that I have seen, would simply drill a small hole on the inside of an existing turn signal housing.  Make it the same size or slightly larger than the strobe light itself.  Then you just put the strobe in the hole and seal with silicone to prevent water leakage.  Then wire it to a switch to turn on.  Basically it's as easy as installing a new light.  Like I said though, don't get caught using it on the road.<SEP>How do i install strobe lights on a car?<EOS>

Hey if you can check the automatic transmission fluid, you're doing better than 50% of Americans.I hope you checked it while it was warm and with the engine RUNNING! (The proper way to check an automatic transmission)If it was low, you add fluid through the dipstick hole. Typically with the use of a funnel. However, be sure that you don't OVERFILL the transmission or you'll experience a slipping transmission.Most transmissions go from the dipstick "low" to the dipstick "high" in a single PINT! This is half of what they sell. Typically transmission oil is sold in QUARTS. So if you are on the low side of the dipstick, only pour 1/2 of the bottle into your transmission to raise it up to the high mark. If you are only 1/2 down the dip stick marks, only pour 1/4 of your bottle into the transmission. (etc.)To change the trans fluid is a little more intensive than a simple oil change, and I recommend taking it to a mechanic if you are not mechanically inclined.<SEP>How do I add/change transmission fluid?

My husbands says:Get under the vehicle, you`ll see a rod coming down from the shifter column, to the side of transmission, held in place by a nut.

Go to a Car stereo shop.  The reason you would go there is because sound dampening is part of high end car audio systems.  The last thing you want is road noise on your expensive car audio system.There are items you can buy such as spray on material, adhesive pads, and non-adhesive fabric type material.  Dynamat is the big popular provider of sound dampening materials, but there are online places like partsexpress.com which will sell you cheaper no-name dampening material.  Just look it up in their car-audio section.You will likely find that decreasing the noise is gonna cost you a good chunk of change and a lot of work.  Usually you need to 'dampen' (add sound deadening material) the doors and floor.  You can also do the roof if that is the main source of your problem.  If you are a DIY'er it can all be done for a few hundred dollars assuming you are comfortable with disassemblign your cars interior parts.  I would let a pro do this as there is too much potential to break panels and improperly install the materials.<SEP>How can I make my car interior less noisy?

easiest way is to unplug the 2 plugs in the air filter intake hose.  Then pull the plastic tube out.  Then loosen the clamp on the intake and the one on the other end near the air filter.

Your problem with moss is due to compacted soil,( nowhere for water to drain down) your lawn needs to have all the moss raked out, after this it will probably look rubbish, buy an "airater: from your local hardwear store, failing that use a fork to make holes in your lawn where the moss was growing prolific, next mix some lawn sand and peat and sweep it into the holes using a stiiff brush, this will almost certainly cure your problem.<SEP>how do you get rid of moss in a shady lawn ?

An attic fan is designed to bring air through windows at the main living area so would not do any good for an upstairs.We have the same problem. Is your attic vented? We set a fan at the bottom of the steps to blow cool air up and then have another at the top to blow it through the room. We also have a portable swamp cooler.The New Air AF-320 evaporative swamp cooler is perfect for rooms up to 200 square feet.

Assuming you have laminate you could cut out a round with a plug cutter or a router with a jig built  to control the movement. Also, if the blister is in a location suitable you could remove a section of counter-top, build a sublayment or "notch" in the countertop big enough to fit a thick cutting board into. If you can picture a built-in cutting board in the countertop. Just an idea instead of taking up the whole thing.<SEP>how to repair a small blister from my counter top from a hot pot?<EOS>

Use bleach to get rid of the mold.  You can also get fungicide at the hardware store.  You have a moisture problem in your attic.  Get up there and find out what's causing it.

you can try to drop the tank and empty it, but thats going to be a huge hastle, the easiest way to do it is to remove the bed. Don't be scared its not as big a job as most people think. There are 6 bolts on the bed remove them by using a T55or a T50 torqes bit or star bit, then unplug 2 wire harness from under the bed found near the spair tire, then remove 3 screws that hold th filler neck in place (where you put the gas nozzle when u pump) Then gab a 6 pack and call a friend(to help remove the bed. You can take it off your self but its easier with a second peson0. Remove the filler neck hose and siphon away. It looks like alot but trust me its not, and youll save yourself alot of time and money. It takes a total of 1 hour at the most.

Front Wheel Bearing and Hub ReplacementTools RequiredJ 42129 Wheel Hub Remover (this is a fairly generic tool you can rent from some parts stores - you may or may not need this tool - you won't know for sure until you remove the hub nut as outlined below)Removal ProcedureRaise and support the vehicle.Remove the tire and wheel.Disconnect the wheel speed sensor electrical connector (2), if equipped.  Remove the wheel speed sensor electrical connector from the bracket, if equipped. Remove the front wheel drive shaft nut. Insert a drift or flat-bladed tool into the caliper and rotor to prevent from turning. Remove the brake rotor. (Removing the dront driveshaft nut is going to be the hardest part of the repair.  It is a large nut - 36mm if I remember correctly - and torqued to over 140 ft lbs) Use 3 wheel nuts in order to attach the J 42129 to the wheel bearing/hub.Use the J 42129 in order to push the wheel drive shaft out of the wheel bearing/hub. (often times the drive shaft will push out of the hub with only hand pressure - the older and more rust on it, the more likely you are to need the tool to overcome the rust) Remove and DISCARD the wheel bearing/hub bolts. Remove the J 42129 from the hub. Important: Ensure that the wheel drive shaft outer seal/boot is not damaged. Remove the wheel bearing/hub and splash shield-noting the position of the shield for re-installation. Installation ProcedureInstall the wheel bearing/hub with the splash shield as noted during removal.Caution: These fasteners MUST be replaced with new fasteners anytime they become loose or are removed. Failure to replace these fasteners after they become loose or are removed may cause loss of vehicle control and personal injury.Install NEW wheel bearing/hub bolts. Tighten Tighten the NEW wheel bearing/hub bolts to 130 N·m (96 lb ft).Install the brake rotor and caliper.Install the front wheel drive shaft nut. Insert a drift on a flat-bladed tool into caliper and rotor to prevent the rotor from turning. Tighten Tighten the front wheel drive shaft nut to 160 N·m (118 lb ft).Important: Ensure that the connector clip engages the bracket properly. Install the wheel speed sensor electrical connector to the bracket, if equipped.  Connect the wheel speed sensor electrical connector (2), if equipped. Install the tire and Lower the vehicle.

Just like you would break in any camshaft. Follow the instructions included, as they are made by guys who get paid lots of money to figure stuff like that out.That said, Make sure you use plenty of asembly lube, and make sure the valvetrain is adjusted. Start the motor and make sure the oil Pressure comes up to speed... probably wouldnt be a bad idea to pressurize the oilsystem before start up. Once the oil pressue is up, go for a drive, and do your best to not stay at a constant speed. Accelerate and decelerate. DONT RACE THE MOTOR!!!! Go for 10-20 Miles, then get back and adjust your valvetrain. This is for a flat tappet cam.

I HAVE THE ANSWER!  But you're not going to like it.  I learned the lesson AFTER my dad died.THE ANSWER IS... DON'T!FOCUS with your wife on making yourselves happy and building a contented life NOW.  DO NOT have it requre your parents approval.  PROVE TO YOURSELF that you made the BEST CHOICE and LIVE and BE HAPPY.True love and happiness with radiate from you and your wife (and kids to be) and your parents will either come along or not.  You already blew them off and did what you thought was right when you got married.  Now be A MAN and keep up with your original decision - YOU KNEW YOU WERE RIGHT BEFORE.  KNOW THAT YOU ARE RIGHT NOW - and get on with creating ultimate happiness.  If they can't see it - they loose out - but you don't.

NO!Dear god no, use gas! If you don't use gas you'll break it if the seal is very old and solid. Believe me I know here, I deal in irreplaceable glass all of the time. If I were to break it, there is no going to the glass shop and getting another!The sealer is a rubber, and rubber breaks down with petrol. It takes some time, maybe even a whole day if it's totally solid, but man it helps, helps a lot. Makes the sealer gooey again. Just get a squirt bottle and keep squirting the seals with fuel and keep it wet for as long as possible. You can feel with your fingernail that it's starting to get softer. Best thing about it is, it has zero effect on the inner safety lining of the glass. I've used this method on 1930's vehicles with the original glass and didn't even harm them.My 1953 Bel Air actually has it in the car manual, to remove the glass use gas. The sealer used then is the same sealer used now.<SEP>How do I remove a windshield with old and hardened sealant, and save the glass?<EOS>
If you are working with concrete you may want to start at the top of the hill and work downward.  This way gravity helps you pull the concrete into place.  If you had the limestone delivered in a concrete mixer, called pugging, then you could basically do the same thing.  Limestone will not hold on steeper than a 20% grade.  In this case you want to definitely use concrete or asphalt.  Also, have you thought about using landings for the driveway to reduce the steepness at the garage and at the shoulder of the street?  Its a good idea.<SEP>How do you build/install a crushed limestone driveway up a hill? We have already graded the dirt road?<EOS>
