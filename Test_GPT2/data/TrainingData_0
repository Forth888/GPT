shorts usually occur wher a wire has to flex; sun visor lamp wire, door wires where they go from the door to the body, tilt wheel, under carpet.....cigarette lighters like to short out..short finders are available, they consist of a circut breaker to install in place of the fuse being blown, and a device that detects high amperage. move it along the wiring harness until it stops seeing amperage, thats where the short is.bobweb, that is an excelent method to find a parasitic draw, but not a short to ground. 1/4 amp would be a very excessive draw.. 25 milliamps is the max. or 1/4 of a tenth of an amp...you probably know this as you seem to know what you're talking about, maybe just a type-o...i bet neither of our answers are what the asker is looking for, usually when people say short, they mean open. am i right, asker? open circut means power doesnt make it all the way through the wire.<SEP>how to find a electrical short in car?<EOS>
There is a tensioner pulley on the top of the engine. My suggestion is, if there is no diagram sticker on the hood or radiator mount, take a photo of the engine before you remove the old belt. Or you can purchase a repair manual from your nearest auto parts store.   You will pull on the tension pulley and the belt will be easier to remove. Then let the tension release on the pulley, install the new belt and pull the tension pulley and do the final install and release the pulley.<SEP>how do you change a serpentine belt on a 1997 jeep grand cherokee six (4.0)?<EOS>

Bleach will not strictly KILL it. If it happens to get to walls, removal of the drywall is the best step.   I recently replaced 11,000 sq. ft. of flood damaged drywall attacked by black mold, after the management attempted bleach.   Black mold attacks absorbent, welcoming surfaces. In the case of drywall, black mold only attacks the paper and paint, not the gypsum.

The rivet tool is used to install rivets.  To do so you must drill an appropriate sized hole in the pieces of metal to be joined.  The size of hole will depend on the rivets you are using and the package will most likely state the size hole.  You then simply insert the long pin end of the rivet into the riveter, then insert the short fatter end of the rivet into the pieces to be joined and squeeze the handle until the pin end breaks free.  The rivet works to hold the pieces together by expanding in the hole.<SEP>How do you use a hand riveter?<EOS>

I used to be a Tin Man...I know how to answer this.  Getting a number of estimates is a good idea, as the person above suggests.However...knowing your own budget and the value of the service you desire in advance of getting estimates is the most powerful way to control the circumstances.Try these steps:1. Make sure your contractor has a few jobs under his belt.  Its not that I want to dissuede a talented company from getting a start, but you need to know that they can complete a job.  Obviously the longer they have been around the better.2. Naturally check their reputation out with the Better Business Bureau (if you live in the U.S.)3. Here is the strongest point:Know the value of the labor and materials you want to put into the project.  Here's how: - In today's world you can take your sketches to any Home Depot, Lowes and most high end consumer home improvement stores and get them to estimate the materials needed to go into your job.Lets say you are working on a new single car garage.  Altogether Home Depot estimates your cost for a 24 x 24 single car garage to be around $6500.00.  That doesnt include getting the slab dug and poured or the labor to build it.If you have three contractors come in with prices ranging from $12,000 - $25,000 and you know the materials would only cost $6500, FIRST - you need to know what each one is giving you...and then start looking at why the high price is so high.  If its high because they are giving you more, then have them re-bid it WITHOUT the extras.  If its high for no other reason then they are trying to make too much money off of YOU... - Basically, if you know the materials and someone can help you figure out what the labor would cost, then YOU tell the contractor what YOU can afford and DO NOT SWAY FROM IT.So here's how I do it know.  I know I've got a project to build that costs $5,000 in materials.  I figure out that the labor is usually 2/3 of the estimate, so I do my own estimate (more of a guestimate sure) which comes out at $15,000.  THEN I insure that I can afford that cost.THEN I get the estimates.  Whoever has the best experience, best reputation and comes closest to my budgeted number is the contractor I would choose.4. DO NOT close on your deal on the same day the salesman calls on you.  There are some HARDCORE closers out there who MIGHT actually represent good companies, but are only out to line their own pockets with your money with a quick sale.  The background language they use for a person who buys on the same day is a "mooch" - which means you are an easy mark to jack up the price and get a financed sale the same night.  Mooches DO NOT know what things cost.  They don't know materials, they don't know labor and they will sign without reading the contract all the way through.Take a day to read all the proposals - MAKE SURE there is language in the contract that protects YOU the consumer.If you do sign, DON'T FORGET - you have a THREE DAY RIGHT OF RECISION - in most or all states of the US.  Meaning that the contract isn't even VALID until 72 hours AFTER you signed it.Some of the old school tin men I worked for used to "spike" the job.  That means that EVEN THOUGH the recision time wasn't up, they would pull a building permit and put it in the customers window to distract the customer from considering a contract cancellation.Watch for strange behaviors like that.One more thing I remember from my experience.If a salesman calls back to the main office having a "discussion" with the home office, it MIGHT be real...OR...he is having a fake conversation (even if its a pretend one with his boss) where they talk about "saving you money" with some materials they have "left over".  This is UTTER BULLSH*T.  The price has already been jacked up and they are allowing you to feel a sense of false victory in "talki<SEP>how do i not get cheated by a home contractor?<EOS>

The dimming circuit for the mirror works on the principle of differential - i.e. if the light coming at the mirror from the rear of the car as detected by a sensor on the face of the mirror is significantly brighter then the light striking the back of the mirror as detected by a photo sensor on the backside of the mirror, the circuit energizs the electrochromic surfce in the mirror (or, on older models, activates a motor that physically tilts the mirror).A quick check - there should be a small hole in the face of the mirror, and a sensor on the rear - are they covered by hanging objects?Also - is the mirror dirty?

A GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interruptor) measures the amperage in a circuit that is being used by the load on the ungrounded (line or hot) conductor connected to it, and compares it to the amount returning on the grounded (neutral) conductor. If the imbalance is more than 5 milliamps (.005 of an amp), it causes the GFCI to trip off within 1/40th of a second. Note: A GFCI is not a circuit breaker, and does not protect against a short or overloaded condition. You can legally install one in a circuit without a grounding conductor (the bare or green wire in your box) but you must attach a sticker that says "no equipment ground" to the face plate. New GFCI's come with these stickers in the package. This will allow you to legally install one in an older house that does not have grounded wiring. Hope that helps.<SEP>How does a GFCI outlet work?

Lets not run to re-wire so fast.  A grounded system is a great idea.

I'd start at either the longest expanse of straight wall or the most visable (your choice), measure out the length of the tile + a 1/4 inch more than the width of the grout line, for example: 12''(tile width) + 1/4'' (grout line width) + 1/4'' (for slop, bow in the wall, etc.)=12 1/2''. Measure this out from your two corners and snap a chalk line. Find the center of the chalk line and use the 3,4,5 method of squaring the intersecting (90 degree) line. The advantage to starting with full tiles rather than starting in the middle is that you get less waste, spend less time measuring and cutting and don't end up working over tiles you've already laid. Also, unless the building is extremely old, the walls shouldn't be so out of square that it is noticable in the laid tile. If it is, use the center method stated above.The 3,4,5 method: measure 3' along the straight line from your center mark and mark it. measure down 4' from the straight line (center mark), then with second tape measure, hold the end on the 3' mark and run diagonally down to the 4' mark. When you get exactly 5' between the 3' and 4' marks, it's square. Mark it, then run a chalkline between the original center mark and the square mark and snap. You now have a perfectly square starting point.If someone can explain the 3,4,5 method more clearly, please do. I have a feeling my explanation might be a little confusing.<SEP>how do you square up a room to lay atile floor?<EOS>

A squeaky noise may indicate a loose fanbelt or a fanbelt encountering too much resistance.In this case the sound will be like: Whinnninnninnninnnn!!!If you have a serpentine belt (a belt that winds around engine components like a snake), you don't necessarily have to replace it. It may be just loose. Snug it up. There will be an adjusting bolt somewhere most likely near the alternator. Buy a Haynes manual for your car at an Autozone ($12.00). It will show you exactly where the bolt is if you can't find it.If you have one belt that wraps around the crankshaft pulley, the air conditioner compressor, and the alternator(a more simpler setup to the serpentine), there will be an adjusting bolt right in front of the alternator. Snug it up if the belt is loose.Does it happen when you are steering? Turn the car on and steer the wheel lock to lock. If you hear a whining sound, you need power steering fluid. Un cap the reservoir and fill it. The Haynes manual will show you where it is.Does the problem only occur when the AC is on? Switch it on and off with the engine running. It it comes and goes, and the belt is not loose, your AC compressor needs oil. Buy a can of R134a AC gas with compressor lubricant and inject it into the input port. The port looks like a tire valve at the top of one of your AC lines. Again, your Haynes manual and the directions with the R134a can will tell you the details.Good Luck! This should only cost you around $20-25 including the manual cost.<SEP>How do you know when your fan belt needs changing? My car (2001 Saturn SL-2) just stalled and wouldn't start for a few minutes.  When it finally started up, the brakes were stiff and it would rumble before it finally get some gas and go.  There was also a squeaky sound as I was driving.  This same problem occurred in Flagstaff while I was up there going to school.  I figured it was the cold weather, but I'm now in southern AZ and there's no cold weather going on here.<EOS>

I've got to agree with the filler option .I too have to fill drilled holes in both white and brown PVC fittings etc. Remove any raised edges around the screw hole with a countersink bit held in your hand..just twirl it enough to clear the rough edges of screw hole.Apply filler...good quality Silicone is the favourite...some of the Acrylics are varying quality so go with the Silicones..If you apply it carefully you can get a good result.

I have faced the same problem.  Rent or buy a pressure washer.  It will quickly remove the mildew and dirt build up.  You will be amazed at how good your concrete walks will look.  The only problem is that the mildew will return over time.  Of course you cannot change the climate in which you live, but you can take some steps to minimize the reoccurance.  Mildew likes damp and shady areas that are not subject to constant drying winds.  Trimming trees and shrubs to expose the walks to sunlight will help.  Correcting drainage problems will also help.  If none of these options are available, consider the purchase of a pressure washer.  An electric homeowners model can be had for under $150.00.  You can then keep the mildew at bay as needed.With all due respect to the other people who have answered this question, bleach is not a good solution.  It is messy, smells bad, and is harmful to your landscaping.  It is also a temporary fix since rain water simply rinses it away over time.  It can also stain your concrete if applied too strong.Good luck with your mildew problem.<SEP>how do you get mildew off a concrete walkway?<EOS>

MeetingWizard meets criteria 1,2,4 and 5.  I think it meets criteria 3 "copy and paste list of email addresses".  An address book is maintained within the application.  Rather than tediously entering each address in the address book, go directly to "Create a meeting request".  Propose one or more dates and times.  On the next "Meeting Event Details" screen, paste your list of email addresses, one address per line or separate with a  comma, to a maximum of 50.  Select the "Add all new addresses to Address Book" box, to eliminate entering the addresses the next time.  I recently implemented this for a local community band.  Many of the musicians are not comfortable using computers, so the two click response without the need for a login was excellent.  The response rate 75%+ greatly exceeded what we were getting with just email.   It has lots of features which came in handy eg reminders to non-responders, adding additional details, printing lists of people attending etc.  The price is great; free.  At one time they had planned a paid version for more than 50 email addresses, but that option does not appear on the website.<SEP>What is a good webapp for finding the best meeting time for a group of people?

If you have a basement, or a crawl-space, you can drill screws from underneath (being careful not to use too long of a screw) through your subfloor to prevent the floorboard from moving.  This is a good cure, but, should only be used as a last resort because things can go wrong in a hurry if not done right.  Make sure you can determine how thick the plywood/subfloor under your hardwood is, and the hardwood itself, and use a considerably shorter screw then the total thickness.  You do NOT have to go into the hardwood, simply up to it so it does not move anymore.  You may have to use several screws for each spot. Have somebody up above making it squeak, it makes it alot easier to find and fix the spots.  Hope this helps, it's worked for me.

SEARCH SITES HAD 2 THAT LOOKED RIGHT.  YOU CAN'T VACUUM SALT THATS BEEN DISOLVED IN WATER AND IMPREGNATING THE FIBERS OF CLOTH OR PILE. IF ITS GRAINS OF SALT, YES, YOU CAN. YOU HAVE TO GET IT UP BY DISOLVING IT IN WATER THEN REMOVE THE WATER WITH A "WET OR DRY" VAC OR TOWEL. YOU HAVE TO DO IT REPEATEDLY UNTIL YOU HAVE REMOVED A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF IT. DO A LARGE AMOUNT OF  WATER THEN GET IT AS DRY AS YOU CAN. MY GUESS IS DO THAT 4 OR 5 TIMES MINIMUM.FROM WIKIPEDIAhttp://wiki.ehow.com/Get-Salt-Stains-out-of-Your-Car's-CarpetHome   >   Categories   >   Cars How to Get Salt Stains out of Your Car's CarpetIf you drive in a cold climate, you'll very likely end up with white stains on your car's carpeting from road salt. Fortunately it's easy, if a little repetitive, to get the stains out. Here's how. Steps In a spray bottle, mix up a solution of 1/2 warm water and 1/2 white vinegar. Spray the stained area with the solution. Press a dry terrycloth towel over the wet area. Remove the towel when it's soaked. Repeat until the stains are gone. Tips If you don't want to spend a whole day doing this, apply the solution whenever you happen to be driving. Just remember to remove the towel promptly and let the carpet dry out. Don't be discouraged by a deep-rooted stain. It will come out eventually. Warnings Avoid the temptation to rub the stained area.

Do you have central air conditioning combined with your furnace?  If not, there may not be a condensate drain.   The condensation is a by-product of running the Air Conditioning.Often, the inside "coil" of the AC is located in the larged duct area between your furnace and the ducting that proceeds into your living areas.  So, a furnace in the basement, typically sees the AC coil above the furnace.  Look for tubes that travel from that unit to the box that sits outside.  One of the tubes goes down instead.  it could be a white colored PCV pipe, clear tubing, etc.   Drips of water will travel this tube to drain into a floor drain near the furnace or into a condensate pump (about the size of a shoe box).  This pump will push the water up another tube to the nearest drain -- perhaps a basement washtub sink.Good luck.<SEP>How do I find the condensate drain on my furnace?
