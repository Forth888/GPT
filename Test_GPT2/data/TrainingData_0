Do you have a old complete lock set and no instructions?  If so go to a hardwear store and find the same type of lock and take notes of instructions.  You could also buy the lock make a copy of instructions and then return lock set.  You will need a tape or rule of some type, drill, hole saw sized at the size of lock set.  I would also suggest a round file and a hammer and wood chisel.1) Locate the Holes Wrap the template included with the instructions around the edge of the door and tape it in place. The template accurately locates the exact spots for drilling into the door. A knob should generally be 38 to 40 inches above the floor; keep the height consistent throughout the house. Then, using an awl, mark the centers of the holes for the lock assembly. The center of the hole in the face of the door should backset between 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 inches from the edge of the door, depending upon the type of lockset.     2) Drill a Hole Through the DoorUsing a power drill with a hole-saw bit of the size recommended by the lock manufacturer, bore a hole into the door. Position the bit on the mark that was made with the awl and then, holding the drill steady, drill the hole through door just until it starts to break through to the other side. Then, to avoid splintering the wood, complete the drilling from the opposite side of the door. (Fig. 2)    3) Drill a Hole in the Door's EdgeNext, using a spade bit of the size recommended by the lock manufacturer, drill a hole into the edge of the door for the latch and latch plate. Drill through to the hole that was drilled in Step 2 on the face of the door.    4) Install the LocksetInsert the latch mechanism into the hole on the edge of the door and trace a line around the latch plate. Remove the latch mechanism and, using a sharp 1-1/4-inch wood chisel, make a mortise in the edge of the door so that the latch plate will be flush with the door. Insert the latch mechanism again, making sure the angled side of the latch is facing toward where the strike plate will sit in the door jamb  Before you screw it to the door, insert the lockset, making sure it is properly connected to the latch mechanism (if this is a keyed lockset, align the keyway downward, as shown). Then, tighten all screws.   5) Mark the Latch PositionClose the door and, using a sharp pencil, pinpoint the spot where the center of the latch hits the door jamb. (Fig. 5)   6) Position and Attach the Strike PlateHold the strike plate against the door jamb, aligning the center of the opening in the plate with the pencil mark made for the latch. Trace the outer edges and inner opening of the strike plate onto the door jamb. (Fig. 6) With a sharp wood chisel, cut a mortise into the jamb equal to the depth of the strike plate so that the plate will lie flush with the edge of the jamb. If the cut is too deep, use cardboard to raise the plate so it is flush. To make room for the latch, use a chisel or a spade drill to bore a hole at the center of the strike plate opening. Screw the strike plate to the jamb. Close the door and recheck the alignment of the latch and strike plate before tightening the screws. <SEP> how to drill a door lock hole? tools to be use and instructions <EOS>
I clean the insides of mine all the time and it's 5 years old and doesn't have any rust. Maybe they need to clean up their act to. <SEP> How can you stop your microwave from going rusty inside? I bought my daughter and her boyfriend a microwave couple of years ago.

The inside has gone extremely rusty, with great dollops of peeling hanging from the roof-yuk!! I can't imagine how they can bear to eat anything cooked in there! I figure that it's the condensation that has caused this and I believe you should mop up any moisture b4 closing the door after use, but they obviously haven't done that.

Until recently, it was possible to edit the CSS (stylesheet) and HTML source of a document.

Turn on the fan, light a match and blow it out and hold it near the fan. If the smoke is sucked into the fan, it's working fine. If it needs to be replaced, it's not that hard.

I have faced the same problem.  Rent or buy a pressure washer.  It will quickly remove the mildew and dirt build up.  You will be amazed at how good your concrete walks will look.  The only problem is that the mildew will return over time.  Of course you cannot change the climate in which you live, but you can take some steps to minimize the reoccurance.  Mildew likes damp and shady areas that are not subject to constant drying winds.  Trimming trees and shrubs to expose the walks to sunlight will help.  Correcting drainage problems will also help.  If none of these options are available, consider the purchase of a pressure washer.  An electric homeowners model can be had for under $150.00.  You can then keep the mildew at bay as needed.With all due respect to the other people who have answered this question, bleach is not a good solution.  It is messy, smells bad, and is harmful to your landscaping.  It is also a temporary fix since rain water simply rinses it away over time.  It can also stain your concrete if applied too strong.Good luck with your mildew problem. <SEP> how do you get mildew off a concrete walkway? <EOS>

remove the brake lines going to the master. Then remove the bolts that hold the master in place on the booster. With the new master, put it in a vice, add brake fluid, remove the plastic caps and let the gravity bleed the system until fluid runs from the ports. You can puch from the rear of the cylinder to force the fluid out, but then you would have to hold the piston in and place your fingers over the ports before you let go of the piston on the rear of the cylinder. Do this until fluid drips freely. then install the master on the booster without the lines yet. Have someone go inside the car and slowly push down on the brake pedal, once they go all the way to the floor, DO  NOT LET THE PEDAL MOVE BACK UP! this will allow air in the system. So when the pedal is on the floor, you go and install the 2 lines back onto the master. One the 2 lines are both on and tight, have your partner release the pedal back up. What this does is pull the air out of the lines and into the master. Top off the master til full, put the cover back on and your done. Test the pedal. If the pedal is spongy , then you allowed air into the system and you need to bleed it. But that is for another question if you need it.Good luck...Ron <SEP> how do i remove the master cylinder on a 1998 jeep wrangler? <EOS>

I have been in the plumbing field 20yrs and these answers I love these are the answers that make me alot of money.Quick run down.If it is copper you will need.Copper cutter/Sand cloth/flux/solder/torch/ A Pc of copper/2 Coulpings.1st cut of the bad section Then clean both ends with the sand cloth Also cut the PC of new copper to length if the pc you took out is 2foot cut a new pc 1/8inch shy of 2foot this will give just a little play you will need it.Clean the ends of the new pc and fold the sand cloth in a circle and clean the inside of the coulpings. (You could buy a ID cleaner but since this is a small repair save the 5 bucks.Put flux on all ends of the pipe and inside the fittings then slide 1 fitting on the old pipe slide the new pc into that coupling then slide the other coupling on the new pc of pipe pull the old pipe down a bit and let the 2 slide together. The 1/4 inch will let you do this.Then heat the pipe up and solder. Remember the solder will go towards the heat so heat up the bottom or sode then touch the other side with the solder and your done.Now if the pipe Is galvinized (THIS MIGHT BE A PROBLEM)You need to cut the pipe where the leak is then unscrew it from the fittings. The bad thing about this is alot of times it does not unscrew or it breaks. I Have went to replace a section of GL Pipe and I ended up removing 30 feet.If it is GAL- I would say Get someone out to the House that Has the correct tools. (Trust me)Now if it is Pex as 1 answer said well you cant fix it.although pex is pipeing for water the fittings that are used are special and the tool you would need to have cost about 400Bucks. So you just cant fix pex by going to home depot.Now there is Plastic pipe that looks like PEX But it is not the same thing. And that pipe is used in mobile homes and RV's for the most part.Now last if its PVC  You need Pipe.small saw/primer/glue/2 couplingsits almost the same as copper but you use the primer to clean and prepair the pipe then glue it.But most people have copper. So your answer is above. DO Not use bread or Glue or Tape.1 Other Thing and this is a MUST!!!!! Shut the water off before you do anywork on the pipes.You would not belive how many people forget about this small thing.Goodluck.And if you get stuck and you need help Feel free to e-mail me at kos101@yahoo.comPS- I was not and am not trying to be a jerk to anyone that put there answer to this question.

I just tore out the carpet in my kitchen and I did the bathroom a couple of years ago. the best thing that i found was a good sharp paint scraper and some elbow grease to remove the glue. then a power sander will smooth and prepare the floor for refinishing.I have been told that you can rent power scrapers that work well too.

I am a Construction Superintendent and I'm here too help.  First I want to say that there is no such thing as a perfectly built home.  If there was, you couldn't afford it.  With that said, you need to send a punchlist, in writing, certified mail to your builder.  Give the builder a reasonable amount of time to make the repairs.  More than likely, the builder used a Masonry sub-contractor.  Try to find out who that is.If the builder and/or the contractor do not address your issues in reasonable time then you simply go to your town hall and look for the Code Official or Construction Office.  I have seen firsthand, almost immediate results when the Code Officials get involved.  They know all of the builders and they should be able to help out.Most builders allow one year for punchlist items, settling cracks and the like.  Give this a try. <SEP> How do I get the builder to fix problems in my new home that they promised to fix?

For all of these, you are trying to reach the mechanism and move it back and forth to clear up a jam. Motor hums but there is no grinding.Turn the power off to the disposal for safety while doing these. You wouldnt want it to kick back on you or shock you.There may be a hex nut that you can reach from the top using a socket, extension and breaker bar.There is a special wrench made for reaching inside and grabbing onto the blades for applying turning power. See if these can be rented from a hardware or plumbing shop.Two short (2') sections of broom handle, put in through the top and jamming up against the impeller blades, then crossed from above to provide a pivot, will let you apply torgue (turning force) to the grinding mechanism.If those methods don't work for you, you may have to drop the disposal and work on it on a bench.In terms of cost of labor, if it's not a fast and simple fix it's usually more cost effective to replace a garbage disposal than it is to repair one, especially when replacing with the same brand. Within brands the plumbing, electrical and mounting collar are usually the same and with all these going for you they can usually be replaced in 20 minutes or less. <SEP> How to fix a GE garbage disposal? suddenly stopped grinding; only hums now <EOS>

No clever tricks here. You'll have to remove the roof covering (shingles) by pulling the nails carefully under the exposed part of the shingle. Get a nail bar for this. Remove enough shingles to expose what sheathing needs replacing plus a bit to give you "tool room". Cut out the bad sheathing using a circular saw set to just a tad deeper than the thickness of the sheathing. Cut out the bad stuff as squarely as you can splitting the cut on a rafter so that you have a nailing surface on each end. Replace the sheathing to match, replace the shingles putting a dab of roof cement over each nail and paint everything to match. You may need to replace underlayment and drip edge as well. Work carefully, measure twice, cut once, don't cut nails with your new saw blade, visualize what you want to do and think before you act. The hardest part will be removing and re-installing the shingles. Don't pound on exposed surfaces of the shingles. Keep everything square.Thanks to nailpounder and samhbane :) <SEP> how to repair roof sheathing? The front left corner of the roof has the edges of the sheathing damaged.

95% of trapped odors are in your carpet, most likely from mildew. To get rid of the odor, you first have to get rid of its source. Go to your local auto supply store (auto zone, advance, O' Reilly, NAPA, etc) and buy some upholstery/carpet shampoo. Look for a kind that also disinfects if available. First vacuum the carpet. Then test the shampoo in a small inconspicuous area to make sure it is color safe. Work the shampoo in really well, blot it dry with a clean cloth, and then let it dry thoroughly. Then vacuum the carpet and upholstery again. you may need to do this a couple of times depending o the severity of the mildew so don't get frustrated. After you're done give the carpet a couple of squirts of your favorite cologne, or air freshener, for a finishing touch. Then you'll be good to go. Hope this helps. <SEP> how do you get rid of a musty odor in your car if it has been wet inside before? <EOS>

You're gonna need chemicals. Lysol, Ozium are good starts. Park the car outside, switch the A/C on full blast, and make sure it's on outside air (not recirc). Roll up the windows and get out of the car. If you look near the windshield wipers, you should be able to see a vent near the base of the windshield. Spray lysol into this vent, about 1/4 of the can. This will kill all the mold that's hiding in your vents, as well as blast lysol into your interior. Let the car run for a few minutes after wards then shut it off. This should help quite a bit. Next is to treat it with Ozium a few times to get rid of what's left of the smell. I'm sure there's other methods that work better, but this is easy to do yourself and costs less than $10.

Your charge will depend on a number of factors.  First, determine the ambient temperature outside.  Then, put a thermometer on the suction line, the bigger of the two pipes on your outside condenser.  Watch the temp of the suction line as you charge the unit.  At 95 degress outside with 68psi of freon on your low side (big pipe) you should have a line temp of 43 - 45 degrees.  Then check the temperature of the air coming out of the vent closest to your a/c inside your home.  Proper outlet temp will be 55-57 degrees.  Do not charge more than 75psi of freon.  This will cause your a/c to not properly change from vapor to liquid to vapor in the cycle.A/C is a tricky  and time-consuming proposition.  If nothing else, hook your blue hose up to the large line Schrader valve (looks like a tire valve) on the outside unit.  Charge it to 70psi and WAIT.  Keep checking the large line temp and the inside vent temp til you get 43-45 degrees outside on the line and 55-59 degrees inside.  Do not over-charge the freon.  As your unit balances the freon in liquid and vapor forms, the pressure will drop, so be patient and use temperature to achieve maximum cooling efficiency.  Stick with 68 - 7O psi on the low-side (large line) on the outside unit if nothing else.  And let it run to allow it to properly balance out the freon.If you get confused, call a tech.  Better to pay him now than make things worse. <SEP> How do I charge a home air conditioner? <EOS>

Set your multimeter to read AC Volts at a range which will work for 120 V.

If there are no shut offs for the bathroom fixtures, then you may have to shut off the incoming water service from the street, road, etc.; it is usually right near the water meter.  This will shut off the water to the whole house.  Then open the faucet at the lowest point of the house, then one at the highest point of the house, it will drain to the lowest point.  Do what you have to do, then shut the lowest point faucet off.  Open the incoming water valve, slowly, with the highest point still open; this will purge any air in the pipes.  Check for leaks.  If all is OK, then let the high point run for a little while to get the air out.

How much you got in your wallet$$$  Base price is based upon how much the Oil producing Czar wants per barrel.

You need bricks.  Let 'em punch holes in a wall. <SEP> How do you stop young kids from vandalising a  5 foot high wooden garden fence?

Repairing the fence is becoming expensive and just seems to encourage them.  Every fence in the lane is suffering so it's becoming a big problem.

If I remember right, most older GE dryers do not have removable back panels. The front panel comes off instead. There is srews at the bottom of the front panel at floor level. After you remove those, pull the bottom outward a ways. From there, you can disengage it from the top, and have access to the area under the drum where the motor and belt tensioner pulley assembly is located. On GE dryers that open like this, the back of the drum is mounted to a shaft that goes through a bearing in the back of the dryer accessible through a small removable panel. The front of the drum rides on 2 plastic shoes mounted to the front panel. Check the bearing, guide shoes, and tensioner pulley. I have had to replace the tensioner pulley, since it is plastic, it wears out somewhat quickly, or cracks and breaks loose from its center shaft. Hope this helps. <SEP> How do I remove the back panel of my GE dryer?

While Citrus oils, cayenne pepper and such will keep cats out of your garden, unfortunately you have to keep applying it every time it rains.  The best thing I've found is Coco Bean Mulch.  A left over product from coco bean production, it smells like chocolate. It is very light, but when you put it down, and wet it, it forms a mat that is difficult for weeds to get through (a harmless fungus grows through it and increases the mat effect).  In addition, every cat that has ever visited my gardens since I put it down hates the smell and the texture and stay away.  I had some cats that seemed to like leaving deposits in my grass, but I crushed some of the shells, and spread the dust over the grass where it settled down and was invisible, and cats no longer even come into the garden.  It seems to work for a long time; I haven't put any new mulch down for a year.

If the leather isn't torn or broken in any way then the finish is just worn off.You can go to several hobby supply stores and find leather dye and finish.  They may even sell a finish remover for leather as well.  If not, get some fine sandpaper and smooth out the old leather while it removes the shiny finish.  Once you are happy with how uniform the knob looks, apply the dye.  You don't need to literally soak the leather but you do need to ensure you have applied enough to penetrate evenly around the whole knob.  Follow the directions on the dye.  I believe the dyed knob should be dry before you add the finish.  I've had good luck with squeezing paper towels over the knob and soaking up all the excess while still leaving a uniform color on the knob.  Once no more dye comes off the knob, I think you are ready for the finish.  Add the finish per the directions and then hand buff with a cotton cloth and voila!  A refinished knob!  Perfect in every way... well almost... I've found it too difficult to try and add any contrasting color like some shift knobs have showing you the different gears.  If they are embossed into the leather, you will have to be careful to not sand them away.This should work well for all the leather in the interior.  Good luck! <SEP> How do you remove scuff marks from an old leather gear knob?Or at least make it look a bit better...? <EOS>

I recommend Citristrip Stripper: it's real user friendly and safe to use inside. As with all chemicals, be sure you have good ventilation though.

None of the previous answers worked for me. Searching for -subject:re and equivalents seem to match EVERY conversation. I believe this is because that search is positive for the first message in the conversation (which does not have "Re:" in the subject line).  What works for me is:   Create a label (I called it "HasReply") using the filter: subject:(+re)  Then search for -label:hasreply or -label:hasreply -from:me   The logic here is that the first search will find all of the conversations with a reply. The second will then exclude those - leaving the messages without replies.  Adding the -from:me addresses a corner case where I'm searching a bunch of emails, sent NOT from me, to multiple recipients, and I want to find the ones NOBODY has replied to. Without the -from:me the results will for some reason include conversations where I am the only person who has replied. Adding this would not be appropriate in answering the original question, where the person wanted to find emails he had sent (which this would exclude) and had not received a reply to.  Alas, it is still not perfect. I create and apply the filter ("to matching conversations") and all is good. Then new replies come in and they don't seem to be added to the label...so I have to go back in like I'm editing the filter and re-apply it to catch the latest messages. <SEP> Search in Gmail - How to search the mails without reply? <EOS>

If you are starting to run into the wear bars, you should replace your tires.  The tread depth indicators usually denote around 2/32" of tread depth remaining, which is the minimum requirement in many states.

Also, even if tires have a lot of tread, the rubber can break down and cause problems.  You can usually tell when a tire is being very loud on the highway and rebalancing won't fix the problem.

Depends on what the juice is and what material the carpet is made from.  Make sure you have the right info before attempting to remove it as doing the wrong thing can set the stain.In any event mop up as much as possible with dry cloths, towels, absorbent pads etc but don't scrub at the carpet.If the carpet's nylon or other man made fabric you can porbably safely wash the juice out with warm water - you can try different solutions including adding salt, vinegar, bicarb or washing powder.Some colourings in juices will permenantly stain fabrics and there's nothing that will remove them - it's basically dyed your carpet.Avoid overwetting, scrubbing or spreading the stain.If it's a wool carpet and none of the above work then get a specialist cleaning company in. <SEP> how do you get red juice out of beige carpet? <EOS>
You start at the beginning. A cracked head or head gasket can have various symptoms. While the engine is cool check the radiator water to see if any oil is present. If no then check your oil to see if any water is present (it will look milky). If no then start the engine with the radiator cap off. Look in the radiator to see if it blows bubbles. If no then check the exhaust to see if much water or oil is coming out or is present in the pipe (Some water is there naturally from condensation. If it doesn't smell like anti-freeze you're OK)If no then visually inspect around the head and valve cover to see if any anti-freeze is present.If the answer is no to all of the questions the head and gasket are more then likely intact. The only other test I would recommend would be a compression test, but if you have never done one you may want someone to show you how or go to a mechanic. If you answered yes to any of the questions you probably do have problems in that area, though some could be caused by  mechanical problems other then a blown head gasket or a cracked head. <SEP> How can you tell if your car has a cracked head gasket?

The gratis Google Docs extension Paragraph Styles+ allows to create custom paragraph styles (plus decimal system outline numbering for headings and a table of contents with page numbering).  I just tested it, and here's my first impression:   Good start. For small-ish documents, it should be good to use :-)  However it runs quite slow, even though recent versions improved on the performance already.  The UI does not integrate with the Google Docs style UI. Probably not possible otherwise in the Google Docs API.  The original Google Docs style feature does not know about custom styles, considering all text with custom styles as having the "Normal text" format. You can use both in parallel, but note that the "Clear formatting" button (looks like " T x ") will remove custom style formatting from selected text.  It seems to store your character styles on an external web service, means you have to entrust them access to your documents the way you entrust them to Google now …   Source: Acknowledging the comment by Chris Moschini above, who mentioned it first. <SEP> How do I add new styles to Google docs? <EOS>

Pretty much the same way you drain a gas, oil, propane water tank. There should be a valve at the bottom, it will have a spout with standar threads, the same threads that a standard garden hose uses. connect a gargen hose to the spigget or the valve with the threads, route the hose to where ever you want the water to drain too. Then gently, very very gently open the valve. If you happen to have a water tank with a plastic spigget/valve then you might be screwed. If it's a really old tank the plastic may have dried or rotted to the point it's so weak that an attempt to open it might just snap off the valve completly. If you do have a plastic valve and if it's really old, I would get your friends to help and gather buckets. Average tank size is probably 20 -50 gallons, if the valve snaps and the tank is full then all the contents of the tank will come gushing out. If the valve snaps, it's no biggie to replace it and it's cheap. It's not all that bad, most times it's a breeze but you have to be prepared for the worst. <SEP> how do i drain my electric hot water tank ? <EOS>
Not quite sure what you are asking-but here goes.HVAC systems can contribute to poor indoor air quality.#1.It is a moist, dark environment that is prime place for mold growth.#2.It merely recycles the air in the structure-it does not bring in fresh air.#3.The "filter" does little more than take out the big particles in the air.These particles are dead skin flakes,dust mites,insect parts,etc....The filter does not remove or kill bacteria,volatile organic compounds (formaldehyde,solvents,benzene)The filter just traps things on it so mold spores have something to feed on.The list goes on,but this should be a start.I could tell you more if you're interested. <SEP> how can HVAC systems be corrolated to IAQ? <EOS>

If the cables have gone bad, they will have wrapped up around the drive spool, kinked, etc. Your only option there is to replace them. The part you need for that is called the "window lift regulator". Dorman makes aftermarket regulators that may fit your car. The motors also have a gear drive and the "dogs" sometimes strip out. I repair those by removing the motor, removing the plate over the drive head (one screw) clean out, and use 3 nylon nuts (solid nylon, not "nyloc") as the driv dogs.Here is how to on these types.Remove door panel and inner moisture barrier.Unplug motor connection and remove the three screws which hold motor in place, These may be "Torx" headed. Remove the motor from the door.To remove glass, you will need to do some drilling. Put window glass in a position where you can see the two rivets holding it to the regulator slide. Carefully use a punch to knock out the pin in each rivet, then drill rvet heat out. Remove the glass and lay aside (carefully of course). You will have to twist window, but it will come out. be sure to remove the inner "wiping" seal on the top of the door.Now all you have left is the regulator. It is held by two studs/nuts at the top, and two rivets ant the bottom which must also be punched, and drilled out.Reassembly is the reverse of removal. Instead of riveting back in place, I use 1/4" blots, nuts, and lockwashers. On the glass, use bolts and Nyloc nuts, ore a plain nut held with epoxy on the threads. The white insulators snap together in the galss. The bolt goes through them. JUST SNUG UP THIS BOLT/NUT COMBO DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN!!!!!Ford dealer in my area quoted 435 bucks to repair one window on a Grand Marquis.

I'd start at either the longest expanse of straight wall or the most visable (your choice), measure out the length of the tile + a 1/4 inch more than the width of the grout line, for example: 12''(tile width) + 1/4'' (grout line width) + 1/4'' (for slop, bow in the wall, etc.)=12 1/2''. Measure this out from your two corners and snap a chalk line. Find the center of the chalk line and use the 3,4,5 method of squaring the intersecting (90 degree) line. The advantage to starting with full tiles rather than starting in the middle is that you get less waste, spend less time measuring and cutting and don't end up working over tiles you've already laid. Also, unless the building is extremely old, the walls shouldn't be so out of square that it is noticable in the laid tile. If it is, use the center method stated above.The 3,4,5 method: measure 3' along the straight line from your center mark and mark it. measure down 4' from the straight line (center mark), then with second tape measure, hold the end on the 3' mark and run diagonally down to the 4' mark. When you get exactly 5' between the 3' and 4' marks, it's square. Mark it, then run a chalkline between the original center mark and the square mark and snap. You now have a perfectly square starting point.If someone can explain the 3,4,5 method more clearly, please do. I have a feeling my explanation might be a little confusing. <SEP> how do you square up a room to lay atile floor? <EOS>

The problem with any of the household soaps is they are made to attack grease, etc. and other substances and break it down. Which means any type of dish/laundry soap will attack the finish (shine) on your paint. Ever see a car with the clear coat gone bad? The owner probably used Joy dish soap time after time. I suppose a very light dose of a baby shampoo just enough to get suds wouldn`t do too much harm, but keep it light. On the interior rugs and uphol. again a very light watered down dish or laundry soap for dirt would be OK, use a brush and `rinse` with clear water. The dash and hard plastic parts (tires) maybe just a damp cloth to clean away dirt, and a very light coat of Pledge-type product? After applying wipe with dry clean cloth. It may however attract dust and remain greasy feeling, haven`t tried that one.

Hard to say without seeing the installation.  Check if sink faucet flow is strong (if not main valve to house or apartment may be partially closed and should be wide open - should check it open anyway).  To check that a valve is open you should be able to turn it a couple turns shut then open it all the way.   If flow is weak do you use a well pump or city water?  If system has low pressure you may not be able to block flow from a sink faucet with thumb pressure (I can stop water flow at my camp using my thumb but not at my house on city water which is probably about 80 psi.  If you have a city water pressure problem, neighbors should have the same problem.  Next, see if there are valves available that isolate only the tub for repairs (if there are any these should be wide open).  Next, is flow weak for both hot and cold water?  Each line would have its own isolation valve if provided.  If flow is weak for both hot and cold water, and there is a diverter valve in the tub faucet for a shower head, the diverter may be jammed due to mineral buildup or corrosion and may be blocking flow.  That may require a plumber or a handyman.  Do the hot and cold valves oof the tub faucet require the same number of turns to full open?  They should be about the same or one may be installed wrong.

Your paint won't adhere for very long if you don't remove the rust.  It depends on the options you have available, if you have a grinder then a stainless steel wire wheel would be an options, you could use a smaller one on a drill.  If these aren't options then you could use a wire brush to brush off the rust or even sandpaper but it's going to take a lot of sandpaper unless you're just using it as a finish sanding.After you remove the rust then you can prime it and paint it.  Rattle can will probably be the least work.  Not sure about the exact size of the pole so couldn't tell you the coverage but if you got a fresh can of paint to brush it on the odds are a lot of it would be sitting around unless you had several of them to paint. <SEP> How can I paint a rusty steel pole? <EOS>

Depends on what car you are talking about. Every computer controlled car has a different voltage input for the oxygen sensor. The sensor sends a voltage signal and tells the computer if the engine timing needs to be adjusted or not. The eliminator sets this to one constant voltage that tells the computer to advance the timing and leave it there. Thus giving your car better performance and acceleration. But you will need to find what that voltage is at WOT for your car. If you have a car with OBDII system (most 1996 to present cars) then you may can get a programmer to bypass these signals and manually set it to what you want. <SEP> how do you bypass the oxygen sensor?

Yea a mix of sand and cement will do it.  You can aide in curing it out by placing a wet paper towel on the patch and taping it down then putting some plastic kitchen wrap over that and taping it down.  If you use the paper towel you'll want a grinder to clean the paper towel up (it will probably stick to the patch a bit) but you can use it to feather in the patch and match it with the existing concrete so that it doesn't jump out too much. <SEP> how to cover up honeycombs in concrete structure? <EOS>
The only real way to learn is hands on. What you can do is go to a community college and take a few classes. Also try and get a job in a repair shop even if its only cahnging oil for a while. That way during the slow times you can try and spend time with the mechanics and give them anytype of help you can. you may be taking wheels of for the mechanic so he can due a brake inspection and before you know you are doing the brake inspections while he does other work and just keep trying to get in there.

knowing what material your countertop is made of will make the difference.  Marble?  A non-grit buffing compound will work;  Corian? same as above, but you have to watch how hard you buff, you can remove the sheen.  Laminated? If your cuts are deep, you can use a dye material to recolor them back to the original, however, the substrata material is a non porous material so you will have to apply a genererous amount and buff it down to level.

assuming the 1.9 is a 4 cylinder transverse mounted, you would simply remove the timing belt cover, removing anything that is the way of it first , such as alt., air cond. comp. , and such, the there is a tensioner you would use to loosen the old belt, and then apply the new one, making sure your timing marks a lined up correctly , you would be well off to find a repair manual, to help with the setting of the timing marks as I can't say right off hand what the proper line up would be, Autozone.com has some good info online for making repairs. <SEP> how do i replace the timing belt on a ford escort? it's a 96, manual, 1.9L <EOS>

I have more service calls on a disposal than any others. The tools you will need are a sevice wrench, flashlight and a pair of long pliers or hemostats. Shut off the power to the disposal first. Then stick the service wrench in the center of the disposal bottom (there should be a place for it on most). If it doesn't have a place to put the wrench, then the only way to unjam it is with a plunger handle stuck inside of the disposal (with the power off) and scraped along the bottom edge to free the cutting element. Either way, your should be able to use your flashlight and pliers to get whatever is out. If the disposal doesnt work after you clear it out, (doesn't turn) try pressing the reset button on the the bottom of the unit. As disposal is only good for what you scrape off of your plate. If you need to throw away larger quantities, it should be thrown in the trash. This will save you the inconvienince and expense of clooging your pipes or wrecking your disposal. Run lots of cold water as well when running the disposal. I've also had to remove coins, wires and even a few shot glasses from them, keep the cap on when you aren't using it.

Tina tinkerbell does timing??? I am afraid to answer this one because if you have cranked the motor without the timing belt you have probably damaged the valves, if as I suspect you were smart enough to replace the timing belt before cranking the motor then the belt could have slipped a notch and just be in the wrong position. This is not entirely good news cause you could have still damaged the valves. I will proceede with the assumption that the valves are undamaged and hope for the best. First you need to get the no.1 cylinder in the tdc position That's top dead center if you don't know already. Then you will find a notch on the the pulley that drives either the camshaft or the valves depending on how many valves you have. If it is two valves per cylinder you will have a camshaft, if it is three or more then you most likely have a pulley for each camshaft (more difficult). anyway there has got to be something to line up this notch with. I would suggest that you go to your local auto parts store to get the manual for this vehicle and it will tell you exactly where this mark is, otherwise the notch will be straight up. And then you just slip the belt back on when the mark is straight up and presto chango the car should start.as long as nothing else is broken.Aloha!!!origionalsurfdude@yahoo.com <SEP> how do i set the timing on a 91 volvo 740 turbo.?

Try tightening the bolts holding water pump to block. I am assuming the pump is installed into the block and not remote mounted.  The leak could also be coming from the weep hole in the pump (small hole in the pump casing) - in which case the seal is leaking and you must replace the pump.You can try the siver leak stuff but it will gum up the rest of the cooling system - not the best idea.If tightening bolts and silver leak stuff fail it is time to pull pump and change the gasket and us a little Permatex when installing the new gasket or o-ring(type dependant).  If you go though the hassle of pulling the pump it is also a good idea to just change the water pump while you are there as the price of the pump is small compared to time involved in changing the pump.

Most trailer wiring kits have you use the frame as the ground system. I recommend that you run an extra wire to each of the lights for the ground. The trailer chassis is not reliable when it gets old and weathered.With that said, you need to energize the plug with the vehicle that you plan to hook up to. Check the running lights when the parking lights are on, then the brake lights, then each of the directional signals.Also, your vehicle is not set up with a towing package you may need to change the blinker relay to a heavy duty type.

First make sure your contractor remove the burned or charred items.  This might seem obvious but on many occasions this crucial part is overlooked.  Secondly using water to clean everything might cause more harm than good. Adding water to burned or smoke affected items often times will "lock-in" the burned smell.  To insure that the smoke smell is lessened in severity ask the contractor to use ozonator in the home's environment.  An ozonator emits an oxygen-3 molecule which attaches itself to the carbon molecules that cause that "smokey" smell and renders it neutral.

Not much. Being a natural material, wood will bend, twist, shrink, warp, cup, and crack. Your best bet is to secure it as well as possible with galvanized deck screws and seal it well from moisture.

Not enough detail.  What is it growing on? What type mold?  Bleach only stops it temporarily, it will return,,,certainly depending on it's environment,,,IE? Flooding, reoccurring moisture, etc.   Dehumidifiers can slow it.   I recently replaced all the drywall in an 11,000 sq. ft. building due to damage and black mold growth from flooding. The organization attempted bleach and Kilz without success.  In this case I cut the drywall 2 inches above the floor line and added moulding to the floor. The flooding may still reoccur, but the water will not attack the drywall.   In the case of drywall and paint, the mold attacks the paper on the drywall and leaches through the paint. It does not attack the plaster substance of the drywall, but that is of little consolation in a case as I mentioned.Rev. Steven <SEP> how do i kill mold permantly? <EOS>
Piece of cake.  Just have all the tools ready before oil is pouring out of the oil pan.  RAGS RAGS RAGS(can't have too many)  Correct size wrench, two gallon tub or something with high sides to minimize splash, oil filter wrench.  You can go to your local auto parts store to get the right amount and grade of oil.  Get a new filter too.  Warm up the oil by running to the auto store.  This ensures you get most of the contaminants out of the oil pan, which is the whole idea behind oil changes.  You're going to have to get under the car.  I prefer ramps, if you can get some they're lots easier to mess with than jacks.  You can rent these pretty cheap.  Have a little tub that will hold a couple gallons or so.    Figure what size wrench fits on the plug.  Un-screw the plug (lefty lucy righty tighty).  Be careful the oil is warm!!  Just let the plug and all go into the tub...you can fish it out later.  Let the car drain real good.  Then take off the oil filter.  You might need a filter wrench.  When installing the new filter just use your hands.  If you insist on using a wrench go easy...overtighen it and you will be sorry when it gets warm.  Don't forget to put a little oil on the new gasket on the filter. Here's where I usually screw up...don't forget to put the plug back in the pan.  After that is done carefully pour the four of five(depending on your vechicle) quarts of oil back into the top of the engine.  Start the car up and look at it real good.  Let it run a while and see if it leaks anywhere.  Now that the oil filter has oil in it you will get an accurate reading on the dipstick.  You might want to back the car off the ramps or let it down if you had it up on stands so the car is level.  Turn the car off and check the oil again to be sure its right.  Shouldn't take you more than a couple hours taking your time...Hope this helps... <SEP> How to change oil in a '98 Stratus ? I need to do it for my self.? <EOS>

Most carpet cleaners are little more than a little soap and water sold in fancy packages.  You will find purified water has tremendous cleaning power on its own.  I would suggest you try it alone for most fresh stains with a white paper towel.1) blot the stain or dirty area when fresh and remove as much of the stain with the paper towel.  Continue until the paper towel comes away clean even if the stain remains.2) Wet the area lightly and continue the process, until the paper towel comes away clean or the stain is gone.3) Mild soap and water with the clean paper towel.If you cannot get the stain out there is a tool called a cookie cutter that can patch an area of carpet.  Take carpet out of the closet corner (where it can't be seen) and replace it in the cookie cut area.  You are swapping the areas and most anyone can do this. <SEP> How to make a homemade carpet cleaner that really works? <EOS>

A lot of raised wood floors or second stories are built using the least amount of materials allowed to save on costs.  That frequently leaves a floor that, while capable of supporting its load, squeeks because the wood is flexing a lot.  If this is a second story you may just want to learn to live with it because it will be a lot harder to fix it then you may think.  If it is on the first floor of a house with a raised wood floor you ban reinforce without really tearing a lot of things up in your house.  There should be a crawl space opening somewhere to get in the underfloor space.  Once you are inside there you can add additional lumber to the joists to help them support the loads.

You never said brand of engine, usually, for homeowners they show the simple method of draining the oil through the filler/dipstick. Though the more complete drain method can be done by taking out the lower drain plug, take a open ratchet, insert it to take it out (depends on engine though), its best to pick or roll the mower up, so its suspended by two cinder bricks by the four wheels(my method anyway), have a container to catch the old oil right below, take the plug out (loosen the dipstick to drain faster) and let it drain completely, put the plug back in good and tight, and fill er up with a good high quality oil.....

The problem with changing a sink, even if it is "standard size" is that there are many small variations from manufacturer to manufacturer. The granite may no longer match the outlines of the new sink. (corner radius may differ slightly.)  If you're set on a new sink, try to get the same manufacturer, some offer different materials in the same style sink.  Now we're getting really tricky because the ganite is seamed right at the sink. Those "arms" that reach out to the sink from either side are the weakest spot. If you're not careful, you may break them off when trying to cut the seal between the sink and granite. I'm assuming that the sink was sealed with silicone when it was installed. What you're going to have to do is:remove the faucetremove ALL the plumbing from under that sink (clearance issues when removing)remove the sink clipscut the silicone seampull out the sinkreverse the processSome things to think about, #1 The sink may not fit between the cabinet doors.  As a granite installer for years, I'm  surprized at the number of times the sink will not fit in the doors, the only way to install it was drop it in from above and then put the granite in place on top.  This happens a lot. #2 possiblility, the sink may be resting on the cabinet frame, in that case, the top has to be removed before the sink can be taken out. #3 there may not be enough room to fit your hands under the sink to cut the silicone seal. This then has to be done from above. Easier, but still have to think about it. Good Luck! <SEP> How can I change out the kitchen sink in a granite counter top? <EOS>

There's no gap, if it uses hydraulic lifters.  Adjust with the engine running for zero lash.

Zero valve lash can be felt by moving the valve pushrod up and down between your thumb and forefinger until there is no more up and down movement of the valve push rod.When all the valve lash is removed, then turn the valve rocker arm nut clockwise 3/4 of a turn.Turn the crankshaft clockwise 1 revolution until the alignment mark on the crankshaft balancer is aligned with the notch in the engine front cover tab.With the engine in the number 6 firing position, adjust the exhaust valves for cylinders number 2, 5, 6, and 7 and the intake valves for cylinders number 3, 4, 6, and 8.Turn the valve rocker arm nut counter clockwise until the valve lash is felt in the valve pushrod.Turn the valve rocker arm nut clockwise until all the valve lash is removed. Zero valve lash can be felt by moving the valve pushrod up and down between your thumb and forefinger until there is no more up and down movement of the valve push rod.When all the valve lash is removed, then turn the valve rocker arm nut clockwise 3/4 of a turn.If the engine won't start due to no compression when you're finished, back off each nut about 1/4 turn and try again. <SEP> How do I adjust the rocker arms on a 350 Chevy?

Will depend upon if your leak is at the faucet or the plumbing underneath the sink. "Rebuild" kits for the faucet are available at those large box home improvement stores. You'll need the manufacturer's name and model. Usually they contain the necessary o-rings, washers, etc. to fix most dripping faucets. Worst case is a replacement. You will probably not need any specialized tools, perhaps a hex key of the right size. Just follow the directions. Try to keep a rag between chrome surfaces and your tools to avoid scratching. Make sure you turn off the water, hot and cold, before you start and put a rag in the drain to avoid loosing small parts.The under the sink plumbing can be a bit of a bear depending on the material used. Plastic is really easy. Disassemble the trap (there's about a cup of water in there!) and check for cracks and worn gaskets. Parts are redily available at that same store. Make sure you have the correct size. Again, worse case, replace everything. Large slip joint pliers or a small pipe wrench may be required.In both cases, look for worn, cracked or pieces that have slipped. Generally it is more cost effective to replace gaskets, small pipes, etc. rather than trying to salvage something. The repairs are pretty easy. Go slowly, keep things in order for re-assembly and things should go fine.I make it a practice to ALWAYS WEAR SAFETY GLASSES, even while doing a job like this.

As a rule, you don't oil the motor, except perhaps at the shaft.  You probably do need to oil the various moving parts of the machine, especially around the bobbin.

The horizontal chalk line keeps the rows in a straight line while the vertical chalk line keeps the courses square in an upright straight line.  The horizontal chalk line measurement is the width of a shingle which is 13 3/8". The rake chalk line gives roofer a guideline to follow when cutting off the excess shingle overhang. To start the horizontal chalk line, find a comfortable and safe location near the lower end of roof along the fascia board roof line and with measuring tape, mark 12 3/8" from edge of overhang up.  Although the shingle width is 133/8" wide, 12 3/8" is used to obtain a one-inch shingle overhang over facsia board and rakes. (barge board)  Do the same to opposite end and connect the two marks with a chalk line strike. Repeat the process to the rake chalk line which is up the incline roof surface on both ends.  The rake chalk line has the same measurements as the horizontal chalk line (12 3/8" plus one inch for overhang) To mark the vertical chalk line use the shingle length (39 3/8") as the measurement, but mark 38 3/8" instead (allowing one inch for shingle overhang again) from edge of plywood (rakes) inward along the horizontal chalk line at the lower end and top end along the ridge.  Use chalk line and snap a line between the two points, but extend the chalk line pass the horizontal line all the way down to the edge of fascia line to get a complete line. Before shingles are nailed in place the vertical and horizontal chalk line must be perpendicular or at right angles ( 90 degrees) to each other. Check the lines for square by using the Pythagorean theorem of 3:4:5 method.  In a right angle triangle with sides of 3, 4, and 5, the sum of square 3 and 4 is equaled to square of hypotenuse which is 5. eg: 3x3=9       4x4=16       5x5=25 On an average roof inclined surface of 16 feet, double or tripple the 3:4:5 method for larger measurements to check roof square - 6:8:10 or 9:12:15. Where the two lines intersect, measure four feet up the vertical line and place a mark (labeled A) and on horizontal line measure three feet out from intersecting point and mark B.  The distance between point A and B should measure five feet.  If the measurement is more or less than five feet then adjustments would have to be made. <SEP> how do i mark a roof off to shingle my house? ive been told i need two vertical lines? <EOS>

It's very straightforward. Just use the following link, changing the latitude and longitude for yours. The z is the zoom index, you can play with it to get where you want.  http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&hq=&ll=35.028028,-106.536655&z=13  I got this information by clicking on the "Link" button in the right hand corner above a map. This will also allow you to get the latitude and longitude for a location.  I don't know of a good way to make a marker on Google Maps, through the UI anyway.  Right click on a point and select "What's Here?" to create a marker, but it will be to the closest thing (business, intersection, address, etc). This essentially performs a search with the latitude and longitude and returns whatever is closest to your search. A URL to do that would be:  http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.128061,-106.535561&ll=35.126517,-106.535131&z=17  With the q (for query I believe) being the coordinates where you want your marker.  A more effective method, if you are trying to send a link to a specific address would be to search for the address in Google Maps, which will give you a marker on the exact address and then use the "Link" button to get the URL for sharing. <SEP> Create a Google maps link to a specific location <EOS>
If you used an oil base stain you can use an oil based top coat or a water base top coat. Look for "Gloss" on the can.please note: wait ATLEAST 24 hours to apply a water base top coat to an oil based stain!If you used a water based stain, ONLY use a water based top coat!!Generally, 3 coats of a top coat will do a great job in "sealing" your project. Remember to sand in between coats with 400 to 600 gritt sand paper (after the top coat has dried). VERY LIGHT sanding is needed in between coats, FOLLOW THE WOOD GRAIN as much as possible, look for a "white dust like" and then move on to a different area. Wipe the white dust off with a paper towel before your next coat. After the final coat just rub out the finish with a piece of paper.

Here's what I found on wikiHow.com. This should work for all cars and trucks.Before getting started, you will need these things:Car Head Lights Wire Electrical Tape Relay (see step 2 for info!) Light Bulbs Switch Fuses Mounting Brackets Hardware to attached brackets and lights. Wire Strippers Wire Nuts. If you are replacing existing lights, skip steps 4-10. 1.Purchase needed materials (listed at bottom of page). If replacing existing units, see tips. 2. Remove the lights from the box and check their amp rating. Get a switch of suitable rating. If a switch of equal or higher ratings can't be found, you will need a relay (see below). 3. Use brackets to mount them in the desired location. 4. Locate a convient place in the vehicle to mount the switch for the lights. 5. Mount the switch in the vehicle. 6. Locate a source of power under the hood that does not directly attach the wires to the battery. (One some vehicles, the headlight circuit may do.) 7. If you found a switch of the needed rating above, connect as follows: source to switch, switch to lights, lights to source. Skip to Step 11. 8. Mount the relay somewhere under the hood. 9. Attach the Light circuit to the "Load" side of the relay (some relays may call this something else). Run wire from power source's Hot supply to one of the relays load terminals. Connect the relays other load terminal to the light closet to it. Connect the remaining connection on the light to one of the connections on the other light. Connect second lights remaining connection to the negative side of the power source. 10. Connect the switch. Run wire from a power source to one of the "Control" termainals on the relay. Connect the other termainal to the switch. Connect the remaining switch termainal to the negative of the power source. 11. Install bulbs. 12. Start car and test. If selected sources fuse blows, replace and try connecting to another source. 13. If they work, proceed. If not check connections. 14. Cover all joints with electrical tape to ensure water tightness. 15. Close hood and use. Warnings :Electrocution hazard.

Remove the inner tube, by removing the wheel from the bicycle. Ensure the inner tube is fully deflated by pressing on the pin inside the valve. Remove the inner tube from the tyres using tyres levers failing that spoon handles also work well. Never use anything sharp. Try to determine the cause if the puncture. There may be a thorn or piece of glass embedded in the tyre. Run your hand gently inside the tyre to check if there is something sharp. Remove if you find this with say a screwdriver. Alternatively check if a spoke is pushing through, ensure the tape inside the rim is sitting properly. Inflate the tyre using a pump and fill a bowl with water and check if any bubbles escape. If they are escaping from teh valve you will need a new inner tube. If however they are escaping from a hole in the rubber remove the inner tube and dry this area, deflate the inner tube. In your bicycle repair kit you will have a tube of rubber solution and a piece of rubber. Spread rubber solution on the area around the hole with rubber solution covering an area just wider than the rubber patch. Leave about 5minutes to dry. Check the rubber solution should be tacky. Peel off the backing of your rubber strip and apply that previously coated side to the rubber solution. To avoid air bubbles forming press from the center outwards. Once satisfied, grate and dust some chalk powder to prevent any extra rubber solution to sticking to your tyre. Leave another few minutes before gently pumping up the inner tube again about half pressure. Check the hole is now fixed by placing under water again. If all is well then deflate position carefully inside the tyre and inflate to full pressure. Replace and tighten the wheel. You should now be ready to ride again. <SEP> How do you repair a bicycle puncture? I have all the tools and a spare inner tube just in case but have only got as far as taking my wheel off! <EOS>

Moss in yards has been a common complaint this spring. It occurs in sun or shade, alkaline or acidic soils and in wet or dry sites. Moss is very adaptable and can grow in difficult conditions. In poor sites, the moss moves in as the grass dies out.The easiest way to eliminate moss is to rake it out of the affected areas and alter the conditions responsible for its presence. If moss is occurring in a shaded area, consider planting the area with shade tolerant grasses such as creeping red fescue, chewings fescue or hard fescue. If the fine-leafed fescues have failed, perhaps it is time to consider alternative shade tolerant groundcovers rather than grass. Surrounding trees may need to have their lower limbs removed or the crown of the tree thinned to allow more light penetration. Remove unnecessary shrubby undergrowth as well.When moss occurs in a sunny location, consider fertilization practices. Even low-maintenance lawns need one or two fertilizer applications a year to grow well. In some cases the soil may be compacted and need aeration as well. Soil testing will provide the soil pH. Grass grows optimally at a pH of 6.8 to 7.2 which is close to neutral. Many people automatically assume the soil is acidic when moss occurs and want to add lime. Iowa generally has alkaline soils and liming can make matters worse. A soil test will eliminate the guesswork.Materials, such as copper sulfate, do eliminate moss in lawns. Use these products according to the label directions. However, copper sulfate only cures the symptom, the moss. They do not change the conditions responsible for its presence. When moss occurs in the flower bed or vegetable garden, simply rake off the moss and till the area. Once normal (sunny and drier) weather makes another appearance, moss growth should slow and disappear. <SEP> how to  get rid  moss in lawns? <EOS>

You've left out a bit of information, such as inground or above, type of equipment etc. I'll post my generic closing guide here for you.Ideally, your closing starts a week before you actually get down to putting the cover on. Get your water balanced chemically first. That week allows you to do this.On closing day: Vac the pool and drain it to just below the pool returns. They are typically the lowest point in the system. When drained to that point, add in a winterizing chemical kit (most pool shops sell them), they typically contain an algaecide, shock and sequestering agent . Remove ladders and rails. You may remove the diving board if you wish, or cover it in opaque plastic sheet and secure it. If you totally remove it,  place something over the diving board jig bolts and lube those bolts or tape with duct tape that jut up through the deck. This can prevent stubbed toes and saves the jig bolts from corrosion.You're done at the pool for the moment. Head over to your pool equipment. If this is a sand filtered pool, you ought to have done a backwash, during the draining process, to clean out the filter. If a D.E. pool, then the same applies to clean off the elements. You can remove them later for a thorough cleaning. If a cartridge filter, just remove the cartridge and clean at your leisure.For all filter types, there will be a drain plug, remove it and keep it out.Over to the pump. All inground pumps will have 2 plugs, one midway back on one side and one directly in front.All above ground pumps have a single one, located at the front, under the impellor housing. Remove them and place them in the pump basket along with your filter drain plug. It's a nice , safe place, that you won't lose them in, as you'll leave the pump basket right where it is. This next part all depends on your pool plumbing, you'll have to decide the best route as they are all plumbed differently and the many different ways to blow out lines would be a book unto itself. You'll need to tap into both the return and the suction lines. Typically for the returns, you disconnect a line between your filter and heater (if equipped) and for the suction, you can go directly in from the front of the pump, without disconnecting anything. Doing it this way, will allow you to blow all the water out of the heater, pool returns, any waterfall or fountain(if equipped) or attached spa. Same goes for the suction line for skimmer, in wall suction for a pool cleaner and attached spa suctions (if equipped). You can rent a line blower from a rent all or your local pool shop, or you can use a medium sized shop vac that has a blow feature. The shop vac hose is actually the same diameter as the inside diameter of most pool plumbing (1 1/2 inch) so it makes a good fit. Blow out the lines, until you only see a tiny dribble at the pool, both suction and return. Charge the line with plumber's antifreeze (not automotive) and blow that through to the pool, for all lines. When you see the dye colour of the antifreeze at the pool, it means that the antifreeze protection is sufficient. Plug with your telflon taped winter plugs, all lines ending at the pool. Put something squishable (empty chemical containers or an old partially filled inner tube) into the skimmer to protect it from freeze damage. Remove the pressure guages from the filter and put them in the pump basket with your equipment plugs.There are 3 basic types of pool heater, electric, gas and solar. You don't mention which you have, so I'll assume if you do have one, it's gas. Open the drain cocks on both sides of the heater header (you blew out all the water , when doing the lines, should just be a little anti freeze that dribbles out) and disconnect the pressure switch from it's compression fitting. No need to store it, just let it hang from it's electrical wires. Turn off both the gas valve on the interior and the gas feed line going to the heater.

There is not a refrigerant called 132.  Autos used to use R12 years ago, then went to R22, and are now R134a.Check the nameplate, it will have all the info on the unit.

Goo Gone is a fantastic product (available at Target and most any hardware store or drug store) and works amazingly well on even pesky sticker residue.  Soak the area, and wipe it away.  It might take repeated applications, but you can remove the sticker without scratching, and without leaving a gooey residue.Note that Goo Gone can affect some surfaces, including some plastics, so you should be careful, especially if it is clear plastic.  I've used Goo Gone many times on plastic glassic and CD cases, so it will certainly work on many plastics, but you should be careful. In the event that Goo Gone seems too risky, you can frequently remove just the adhesive residue using plain old Scotch tape.  Remove as much of the sticker as possible (the paper/plastic backing) and then apply tape to the sticker residue firmly.  Pull the tape off sharply, and some of the residue will come with it.  This is a slow process so only do it if the area is relatively small, however, I frequently use this tactic for price tags and the like and it is surprisingly effective. <SEP> How do I get a sticker off of a car window  (plastic part)?

I use Lysol spray.  The main ingrediant is alchol, so you can use de-natured alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol too, which is less expensive.

You would have to hire a company specialized in lead paint removal.  I believe most states require lead paint removal be performed by licensed professional because of the health risks involved.

If you are looking at your gas meter, you should see four dials straight in a row. Pay close attention to the numbers on the dial and the rotation of the pointer. The first dial should be read counterclockwise. Record the number the pointer has just passed. For example, if the pointer is between the number 4 and the number 5, for dial one, the number would be 4 (counterclockwise dial, the number the pointer just passed). The second dial should be read clockwise. Record the number the pointer just passed. For example, if the pointer is between the number five and the number 6, for dial number two, the number would be 5. The third dial is read exactly like the first, counterclockwise and the number the pointer has just passed. The fourth dial is read clockwise, but this time record the number the pointer is nearest. To determine how much gas you have consumed this month, record your meter reading today. Then come back one month from today and record your meter reading again.

Take the old pads out.  Using the bungee cord, hang the caliper somewhere that will give the rubber brake lines some slack.  Take your emory cloth, and sand circles into the rotor.  Not to make marks, more just to remove old brake dust and glazing.  Spray down with the brake cleaner thoroughly.Take the new pads, and follow the instructions on the inside.  You will be greasing where it tells you to...the BACK of the pads where there will be a metal to metal connection.  DO NOT GET THIS GREASE ON THE ROTOR.Place grease on the contact points on the calipers as well.  Use Brake Grease, or high temperature grease.There should be a giant piston on the brake line side of the caliper.  With the c-clamp, depress this.  You may get some fluid spilling out of your brake resevoir, but it's ok.

Usually I can tell how much my clutch is worn by how far the clutch pedal comes off of the floor before it engages with the flywheel.

Do as the previous answer to get the brake caliper off, then remove the dust cap, cotter pin, hub nut.  When you pull it off the outer wheel bearing will come out.  The inner wheel bearing is trapped by the inner wheel bearing seal.  you'll destroy this seal getting it off but new ones are about a buck.  Clean all the grease put of the bearings, inspect them and re-pack them if you are reusing them.  The part the bearings ride on inside the hub is called the race and they are pressed in the hub.  Your new hub should have them in there already and you may want to buy new bearings just to be sure you're good.  I usually don't but you may want to.  Put the freshly packed inner bearing in the hub and tap on the new seal gently w/ a block of wood for a buffer.  Slide this into your spindle and place the outer bearing on.  Put the washer with the little nub orientated in the groove on the spindle and then put the hub nut on.  Tighten the nut and turn the wheel.  Keep tightening till you feel good resistance in the wheel turning effort.  Back off the nut a little and then repeat this step again.  when you have the wheel just to where it spins freely, hopefully your cotter key will line up with a hole.  Adjust slightly as neccessary.  Replace the dust cap, clen ALL grease from front and back of brake disc and reinstall the brakes. <SEP> how do u change a hub rotor? ford f150 xlt2 weeldrive <EOS>

Many central heating systems last 25 years or more. You didn't mention what type of furnace you have, forced air, hot water and what type of fuel it burns (gas, oil, electricity, propane, wood, coal, etc). Other factors are whether you have air conditioning, a separate domestic hot water heater or combined boiler and domestic hot water heat. Because of rapidly rising energy costs, one approach you can take is to compare the costs of running your current utilities versus how much you could save by upgrading to newer more energy efficient appliances. A 16 year old heat pump or refrigerator for example should definitely be replaced with new energy efficient models that only cost half as much to run. This assumes you don't plan on moving to a new house in the next 10 years or so. New condensation type gas fired hot air furnaces run so efficiently (90%) that they only need a plastic PVC pipe for a flue. <SEP> How to know is time to change a new Furnace ?

MindTouch Platform and MindTouch Core are both self-hosted. The UI is non-invasive and very clean. You can use MindTouch Platform in conjunction with the desktop connecter to import your docs. More steps than viewing a document in Google Docs, but does give you the security of your fire wall. And the WYSIWYG editor makes editing documents as simple as Word.  [As a css junkie and a page linking maverick, I would much rather stay out of Office products and use a solution like MindTouch.] You can still "Paste from Word" in the free edition if you don't want to pay for Platform.

Hi, first of all you need to pull the bonnet release lever from inside the car. On most Vauxhall's it is in the footwell area of the drivers seat, (if not, try the passenger side).It is a little lever about 4 inches/10 CM long close to the plastic side of the footwell. (the side nearest the door).once you have pulled this, get out of the car and go to the front of the car. the bonnet should now lift up a couple of inches. either look in the gap, or feel for the catch that is near the middle of the bonnet, but slightly to one side. The catch is "L" shaped, but upside down.You should be able to feel the catch and push it upwards and this will release the hooked end of the catch.Good luck   (And make sure you own the car or have the owners permission. lol). <SEP> how to open bonnet on a vauxhall cavalier 1990? <EOS>

You must first remove the old one.  Start by getting a drain pan.  Put it under the drain plug of the radiator and open it.  It should be a valve at the bottom that will turn with minimal pressure from a pair of pliers. Open the radiator cap to allow breathing while draining. Once drained, then you will need to remove the hoses.  Should be two, an upper and lower.  I would do the lower first.  After the hoses, you'll need to undo the two transmission lines assuming you have an automatic transmission. If it's a stick shift this part isn't necessary.  You'll likely want to "stop up" the ends of those lines so tranny fluid doesn't leak all over.  Eyeball your new equipment beforehand to make sure all these inlet and outlet connections are going to be the same on the old one and new one.  The overflow line from the cap area to a separate bottle will also have to be disconnected.  Next would be to locate whatever brackets and bolts that need to be removed to extricate the old radiator.                                   There should be a fan shroud or a fan assembly with shroud that you will have to figure how best to remove. depending on how your car is made, it may be easier to remove the whole fan assembly after you remove it and the radiator as one unit. When I did mine, there was one electrical connection to the fan assembly that was actually attached to the radiator itself.  I disconnected the electrical plug and removed the assembly after removing the radiator.  Much easier to get to that way.  Then you begin doing everything in reverse order to install the new one.  make sure you refill the new one with the appropriate mix of coolant and water.  Half and half is pretty common but you may want to consult your manual. <SEP> how do i put in a radiator? <EOS>
One way is to log in using a mail client that supports IMAP . You can then export the emails to a backup location, but this is a bit laborious.  If you want a continuous backup, you could try something like imapsync . This would require you to run your own backup IMAP server and schedule a regular task to perform the synchronisation.  Edit : Preserving labels should work fine, but not quite in the way that Gmail handles them. I've not seen any IMAP or POP3 servers which handle the Gmail label system properly. Gmail presents each tag as a separate folder through IMAP, so as far as the user is concerned, the message exists in several places. (In fact, the inbox is just another label). If you synchronise your account to another IMAP server, you will essentially have multiple copies of the same message. <SEP> How can I back up all emails stored in my Gmail account? <EOS>
I do not know where you live where you can leave the windows open all the time.  I have to assume perhaps the islands.  I live on the ocean and battle the salt daily.  The windows are always closed with the air running.  Just keeping the outside free from rust is enough and almost impossible.Everything that you buy for your home must be stainless steal or aluminum.  Any other metals when exposed to the salt air will corrode.  That is science.  Even my ocean grade hardware is pitted and all power coated aluminum fixtures are pealing.

If you have forced hot air furnace with a supply in the bedroom and no return, simply "undercut" the door, that is leave about an inch clearance between the door and the floor.

1.   Pour cola on the oily or dry stained areas, and leave the cola on overnight. Squirt a generous amount of dishwashing liquid into a bucket until you have a good lather. Rinse with the soapy water, then with a garden hose.    2.   Sprinkle baking soda or an absorbent powder such as cornmeal or sawdust on the oily spots. If the stain is dry, wet it first to make a scouring paste. Scrub with a stiff brush or push broom.    3.   Sprinkle automatic dishwasher detergent on the oily concrete. Leave it for several minutes, then pour boiling water on the stained area. Scrub with a stiff brush or push broom, then rinse.    4.   Try a commercial concrete cleaner such as Garage and Driveway Cleaner by Red Devil Co. or a grease solvent such as Benzine. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.    5.   Sprinkle trisodium phosphate (TSP) on the oily concrete. If the stain is dry, wet it first. Let it stand for 30 minutes. Scrub using a stiff broom. TSP is a dangerous product; if you must use it, wear rubber or latex gloves, safety goggles and protective clothing. Also, never wash a TSP product down storm drains.    6.   As a last resort, combat tough spills with muriatic acid and a pressure washer. Apply the acid following the manufacturer's directions, and let it soak for several seconds. Follow with a pressure washer set at 2,500 to 3,000 lbs. per square inch (psi), or 176 to 211 kg per square cm. Like TSP, muriatic acid is a dangerous product; likewise, if you must use it, wear rubber or latex gloves, safety goggles and protective clothing, and never wash such a product down storm drains.    7.   After trying any of the strategies above, sprinkle baking soda over the cleaned area to neutralize the solution you've used. <SEP> How do I remove oil stains from driveway? <EOS>
The first and most important thing you MUST do is to disconnect BOTH of the battery cables from the battery. Now, locate your starter and if space allows remove all the wires that are attached to the starter solenoid. Next remove the two large bolts the hold the starter to the engine block. You may need to loosen or remove one or more sheilds around the starter. Once you have removed those two bolts, it should come right out. Now, when you go to install the new starter, be sure to read the installation instructions very carefully. You may be REQUIRED to install a shim between the new starter and the block to ensure proper starter engagement with the flywheel.Once you have determined whether or not you need to install a shim, you can place the new starter in the same location as the old one and reinstall the two starter attaching bolts.  Then reattach all of the wires in EXACTLY the same locations as they were removed.Then reinstall you battery terminal cables and start vehicle.The starter should turn the engine with a minimum of noise. If the starter does not want to turn the engine over easily, the starter is too close to the flywheel and you will need to add a shim. If the starter makes a grinding/whirring sound when engaged, it is too far from the flywheel and you will need to install a thinner shim or remove it all together. I hope that helps! <SEP> How do i change a starter on a 1991 OLDSMOBILE CUTLASS CALAIS? is there a good wibsite that will tell me how to change it? <EOS>
I would advise against using brushes unless you practice the utmost care because of the potential for dirt lodged in the bristles, or the bristles itself, to marr the paint.  If you're interested in foam, I would strongly recommend using a Gilmour foam gun (you'll find 5 dollar ones at Wal-mart, but they're more like mixers rather than aerating foamers) in conjunction with a sheepskin wash mitt or a hydrophillic sponge (aka a grout spone, it may sound a bit unorthodox, but when they're wet, they're amazingly soft and less likely to trap dirt and cause marring).Anyways, good luck. <SEP> How could i put together a portable foaming brush system like you would find in a car wash? <EOS>

Do you know if the heater worked before you moved in??  Maybe it's been broke for a while.  If it did work and it looks to be in decent shape, then it's possible you aren't getting the match near the right place.  It's also possible that there may be another valve in the line, (actually there is supposed to be another valve), besides the saftety valve on the unit, that shuts off the gas to the thing completely.  That may be closed.   If it is, no amount of fooling around with the saftety valve is going to get it to light.   If you can find such a valve, it will usually have a red handle, or knob, that will be turned to a 90 degree angle, (crossways), to the pipe it's installed in.  If it is in that position, then it's off, turn it so it's in line with the pipe and then try to light the pilot.   If you've held down the pilot button for at least a minute and don't smell some gas down by the pilot area, then the gas is most likely turned off, or the saftety valve is no good. <SEP> How to light a gas heater? I just moved into an apartment with this old gas heater that is so difficult to start. There are no instructions besides "turn all valves to off position. Wait for 5 min. Apply lighted match to pilot at the bottom of firebox.

If your main bearings are worn out most likely the other bearings and parts in the engine are worn as well.

best way to do it would be to go up the stud cavity into the attic or down to the basement, run it to where you need it then back up or down. All you have to drill then is the top or bottom plates.Example: go into the attic, drill a hole in the top plate of the stud cavity, drop the fish tape through, go back down and put something like a coathanger in the phonejack hole so you can hook the tape. Connect the phonewire to the fishtape (elec tape works), go back to the attic and pull the fishtape out.

Try locating the drawings for your home.  We (Florida) are required to keep residential plans on file for 15 years.  Hopefully, your truss engineering would be included in those plans.You can very easily get an opinion from a licensed architect or engineer with your truss engineering.If it was conventionally framed (i.e. 2x6 or 2x8's) then you need the span distance, your first floor construction criteria and your footer design.  Not to knock calling a contractor, but I would run the information by a licensed architect or engineer.  They would have to provide you sealed drawings for your permit anyway. (Sorry, maybe not where you live but in Florida for sure.)I would not do anything with the space if you are unsure.  If the space was not designed for attic storage, nevermind a habitable living space - the end result, such as a collapse may not even be covered by your home owners insurance if you don't do it properly.Maybe contact your local building official, perhaps they would answer a question or two.Best of luck! <SEP> How do you know if an attic is strong enough to be a living space?

Start the honda. Find or buy a 3' length of new fuel hose. Stick one end in your ear and snoop around the intake system with the other end listen for any pronounced "hisssssssing...". [Warren Bain] I was able to isolate a vacuum leak with a mechanic's stethoscope with the probe removed and only using the tubing to get very close to the gasket and follow the contour of the manifold. You can also modify the stethoscope for locating vacuum leaks by replacing the probe with a length of plastic hose or fuel line. Spraying With Liquid.

Unless you remedy the conditions that are allowing the mold to grow, it will eventually find its' way back, assuming you could get rid of all of it in the first place.

The center terminal on the plug, indeed, needs to be connected to the white wire and the red and black wires to the side terminals.  You need to connect a ground wire preferably green from someplace on the stove to the grounding connection on the plug.  The stove will work just fine without it but if something goes wrong with the internal wiring of the stove, the chassis could become "hot" and the breaker wouldn't trip.

So I bought a 3-prong cable...My confusion is that the 4-prong cable has color coding (white,red,black, and green-for ground), but the 3-prong cable doesn't.How do I connect the new 3-prong cable? I heard that the "white" cable (happens to be in the middle of the three cables in my range) has to connect with the middle of the cables in the 3-prung cable.  Is that correct?I was also told that because there is no fourth cable, to leave the grounding screw alone in the range (where the green cable used to be connected).Any help appreciated.

Sounds like you are referring to the wheel and not the tire. The tire is the rubber part. Bicycle wheel bearings can be adjusted using tools called cone wrenches. A cone wrench is a very flat wrench that will hold the cone-shaped bearing surface steady while a jam nut is tighted. The cone can be turned to tighten it up so that there is no play, but the wheel still spins easily. Then, using a cone wrench, hold the cone steady while you tighten the jam nut. Not all bearings are adjustable this way. Some may need to be replaced as a unit, which could require pressing the bearing out and pressing a new bearing in. Finally, it should be noted that the bearing is not always the cause for a shaky wheel. It could be that the wheel is not true, and/or is out of round. Truing a wheel can be done with a spoke wrench and some patience. An out of round wheel will probably need to be replaced. <SEP> How can I tighten or repair bicycle tire bearing? my back bike tire is shaking and i know it's not suppose to do that. how can i fix it without having to get a whole new tire. <EOS>

For example you want to know how to integrate a function in Mathematica, then you enter  integrate x y dx  on Wolfram|Alpha and click on the result to see that the corresponding Mathematica plaintext input is  Integrate[x y, x]  Suppose you want to know how to graph a list of data points in Mathematica, you could enter  graph n^2 from 1 to 10  on Wolfram|Alpha and click on the 'Mathematica form' link (in the first box) to see that  Plot[n^2, {n, 1, 10}]  is the corresponding Mathematica form.

About the easiest way is to get the car in the air (ramps or jack stands) start the engine and let it idle, and have someone "plug" the tailpipe with a couple of rags. This will create back-pressure in the exhaust system, and you'll hear a loud hissing noise from the leak. Just follow the hiss until you find the source, and there's the leak!! You should also be able to feel air coming out of the leak. DON'T TOUCH THE EXHAUST, IT IS VERY HOT!!!

First answer was a good one. Pack all entry holes with steel wool IF you cannot properly repair the holes. A tin can lid works well also. Mice don't like metal.It sounds as if Momma was already there inside somewhere and gave birth. 8 in 3 days suggests a new and hungry family or an infestation which will only grow. Do you have an attic? If so, bait it with traps. Small chunks of Snickers works great as bait on the trap. Put traps all over attic for three days, clean them, leave them out for 3-5 days and reset them for another 3 days. Do this until all mice are gone. If you have a crawl space under your house use the same routine. as for the attic.Check everything outside that is near and/or touching your house - even tree/bush limbs. Mice can climb anything - amazing little creatures - so look at all possibilities.If you cannot stand to use traps and clean up the aftermath then there are some great dehydration poisons on the market. Dehydration works from the inside out. Ingested, mice usually search for water, thus leaving their den. Reaction however drys them out leaving just the dry remains intact and easy to dispose of.

Dont listen to people who say oh its only 2004, its new, you dont need to, your filter life depends on the air quality in your area, but a year, or 12,000 to 15,000 miles, typically is the recommended replacement interval. A cabin air filter may be in the outside air intake, visible with the hood up and perhaps a cover lifted. Or it will be under the dash in one or both of two general locations:• Above the blower in the back section of the outside air intake, a location well protected from moisture.• Between the blower and the rest of the HVAC case.If the owner's manual doesn't tell you the location, and you can't see it with the hood open, check behind the glovebox--perhaps you'll see an obviously removable (with a spring-tab or similar retainer) rectangular plastic cover. Next, look under the dash (on both the driver's and passenger's sides) for a removable plastic cover in the HVAC case. If you can remove its cover, look inside the HVAC case.Still no answer? Buy the filters, something you have to do anyway. You've got two choices:• Buy the factory filters at the dealership at full price. This way, you'll know for sure what they look like and get some idea about how they have to be installed. You'll also find out how many your vehicle has. The parts department should have a diagram to show you where the filters are located in the car.• Buy aftermarket filters that come with step-by-step instructions from an auto parts store. The odds of the original equipment parts coming with instructions are extremely slim. Do all aftermarket filters have them? No, but if you're shopping at a parts store, you should be able to check in the boxes on the shelves. Also, these parts probably will cost less.Replacing The Filters In The Air IntakeThe filter in the outside air intake (even if there are other filters) takes care of most of the dust and pollen, so it's likely to plug first.The typical procedure begins with removing the air intake screen, which is held by "Christmas tree" plastic fasteners. If the "tree" has a center pin, pry it up with a thin-blade screwdriver and then wiggle the tree out of the hole. If the tree is a single-piece design, you'll have to pry it out. Most of the time, it will break and you'll have to replace it (blister packs of replacements are sold in most auto parts stores).If there's a rain/snow deflector over the filter, remove it, then extract the element. The filter element may be held by a plastic tab, or it may slip into a retainer housing that you will reuse with the new element. Some dust may have gotten around or through the filter. Use a vacuum cleaner to clean the outside air intake duct. Be careful when you reinstall the air intake screen, as well as any cover over the filter element. If the gasket surface around the screen does not seal, or if the cover (actually a shield, in most cases) is not reinstalled, rainwater can flow into the filter, saturating it.In The Case, Above The BlowerIf the filter is in the case above the blower, most likely it is behind the glovebox. Removing the glovebox may be easy, but you may not have to remove it at all.Many filters (such as on most Hondas and Toyotas) are just above the blower behind the glovebox, and you'll have to drop it for access. In the best of cases, you can flex the sides of the box so the pins clear the dash, then pivot the box down for clearance. In others, the entire glovebox assembly has to come out, which means removing a number of retaining screws, not all of which are visible.The cabin filter is a type of air filter that in some respects--such as pleating to provide a lot of surface area in a small package--may resemble an engine air filter. However, it usually is made of different materials, the main one being a charcoal layer in many elements. Like some engine air filters, the dust and pollen filtering ele <SEP> How do I replace the 2004 kia sedona cabin air filter? <EOS>

The heater is probley electric so I would first check the fuse/circuit breaker box to see if the fuse/circuit breaker is tripped. If the fuse box is okay then you will need to access the heater and open the panel there the electric wires coming in. Using a amp meter, test to see if amprage is being drawn through the wires to the heating element. If no amp's are being drawn then the element is possibly burnt out. However the tempature control circuit may not be sending a signal to the control relay to turn on the element. Check the tempature control circuit board to see the thermocouple is connected and the boards output relay is energized using a volt meter. If there is no voltage output from the circuit board to the heater element then the tempature control circuit board is faulty. It has been by experience that if the tub is drained and the heater is left "on", the heater element burns out because the element doesn't have any water around it to keep it at normal tempature. Some tubes also have a sensor that detects when no water is present and shuts down the power to the element. This sensor circuit may also be faulty so if you replace the element it still may burn out. Have a qualified service tech thoughly check out the system, it's worth the money and a warranty on the work. <SEP> how can I determine why  my hydrojet water heater is not working? <EOS>

the first step is to remove the negative battery cable from the battery (no sparks if the wires touch anything). next step is to find the belt tensioner pulley (it will look like a pulley that is not attached to any major components) use a ratchet with the proper sized socket and apply pressure as if trying to remove it. the tensioner will move with a moderate amount of pressure (if it doesn't move or the nut starts to loosen you don't have the right pulley). while holding the tensioner down remove the belt from he alternator. then loosen the alternator mount bolts and the wire from the back of the alternator. install the new alternator. everything else is just the reverse order of installation. hope this helps some <SEP> How do I remove an alternator from a 2002 Kia Sedona van? <EOS>

How old are the windows?  You may want to talk to the manufacturer before you do anything.  They may be able to offer the best suggestions for your windows.The problem has to do with relative humidity, the temperature inside your house and the temperature outside your house.Several conditions can increase condensation problems. If you close drapes over windows, this can cause the glass temperature and the temperature of the air between the drape and the glass to become cooler, making condensation more likely.  If the thermostat setting is dropped substantially at night, this will cause an increase in relative humidity and may increase condensation. This condensation should vanish once the temperature rises in the morning.  Cooking with uncovered pots, taking long showers, and poor ventilation overall all add to the humidity in your house.These sites offer some suggestions.

Well, better to use a spirit level. Don;t have one? take a water pipe, around 6 or 8 mm dia. Fill the water. If youe machine has legs, take one as a master. mark a distance from ground say 100 mm for all the legs. keep the one end of the tube at the master leg" 100 mm mark. ensure water level inside tube is inline with the mark. Let some one to hold. Take the other end to other legs. Hold it along the mark, Now you can see whether this leg is Lower/Higher than master. I advise better buy a spirit level in market.

IAT, should mean intake air temperature sensor that tells your onboard computer how to adjust fuel etc. So you need to locate just before the inlet.

My husband used to be a trash man, and he said that if you put cat litter or sawdust in the cans to dry them up you can then stick them in black trashbags and put them at the curb.  The reason they won't take them is that paint, paint thinner, and varnish has a tendency to set the back of the truck on fire (happens more than you'd think).  It's also a danger to the driver if the cans are punctured and they breathe it in.

All machines are different, but this first part is always the same, you want to unplug the machine, remove the needle and any bobbins of thread.  Then check your owner's manual for specific oiling points and the correct screws you may need to remove to grant you access.  To insure that after oiling it just does'nt wind up creating alot of gunk instead of a smooth working part you'll need to clean the areas of lint and dust. Make sure you use just one or two drops of a light machine oil (like 3in1 oil) per oiling point.   Good Luck! <SEP> How do i oil a sewing machine? <EOS>
Most speedometers are not 100% accurate and tend to read high if anything. Have you changed anything on you car? Wheel size, final drive ratio, etc? Those might affect the accuracy of your speedometer. Other than the already suggested ways of timing yourself using a 1 mile road marker, you can also have a friend pace you in his car and tell you his speedometer reading or you could borrow a friend's GPS unit and check your speed on that. If you're off by more than 5%, it's advisable to have your speedometer adjusted to the proper speed by a professional as an incorrect speed reading will have adverse effects on certain safety features such as ABS and proper airbag deployment. <SEP> How can you check your speedometer to make sure it's reading right?

First. do you have a warranty (just take it back). Second. do you have a lot of time. What you got to do first is check weather its the bulb (different wattages will mess you up check manufactures specs also it may have a voltage rating on the original bulb if it is a special one don’t go on just looks of the bulb 100W and a 50W and they are different look a lot alike check the labels on the bulbs) or the opener. An ordinary run of the mill VOLT meter can steer you in the right direction test from the very back of the light socket "the positive" and the shell that holds the bulb "the negative" . you should get a voltage (I would assume that it is 120 may be there is a transformer got to take a look at it in person) or not from what I see the opener works fine so it must be internal what I would do (if I had a lot of time) would be tear the opener open and check for a lose connection. Or just smell it (just a sec. don’t think that I am crazy just yet) using your senses is a good troubleshooting ability. If something like a transformer bringing down the voltage for a certain bulb, burns up, yeah you can smell it if you get a little closer, or circuit board for that matter. a lot of electronics parts are readily available at radio shack and bring the burnt up part to them and they know everything about sizing resistors or what have you then get out the soldering iron (don’t tear that thing apart with the power to it, some models of openers just have a male receptacle end unplug it) if it is a standard green circuit board just look for a little brown dirt from something burning up (not to hard right just time consuming) if there is more problems post another with a little more info <SEP> How to fix a garage door light?

Hi Kelly there are two parts to the answer to your question. The first part is how to do it and what tools are needed. That answer is here. http://www.rldassociates.com/zx2/howto/belt.htmThe second part is why does it keep coming off. The answer to this is trickier. Serpentine belts must be very carefully aligned. Even an eighth of an inch out of alignment can cause the belt to slip off or fail prematurely. Once the belt is installed you must be sure that the two idler pulleys and the belt pretensioner pully (see diagram at URL above) are exactly in line. One way to do this, if you have a good eye is to sight down the edge of the belt from several angles to be sure that all of the edges match. If they don't you will need to adjust one or more of the pulleys. Another, more accurate way is to place a straight edge (a metal yardstick would be perfect, but a piece of pipe or angle iron could be used too, against the edges of the belt to be sure that all of them are perfectly in line. If everything is lined up and the belt is properly tensioned that should take care of your problem permanently. If it doesn't, the pretensioner is probably either worn out or out of adjustment. Ford uses nylon spacers in the pretensioner and they can become brittle and fail because of age and the heat in the engine compartment. Good luck with this. I hope it helps. It's a job with some challenges because of how difficult it is to get at all of the twists and turns of the belt. <SEP> How do I replace a serpentine belt that has slipped on a 98 Ford Escort Zx2?

There's absolutely no reason not to refinish and continue to use it, provided the rust isn't excessive to the point that blades are deteriorating.  Paint on some rust gel, the chemical reaction turns the rust into a stable material.  You can paint it on without removing the blades probably.  Follow directions on the gel.  You'll probably have to hose the cage off as a last step.  Then get a good quality primer in a spray can - not the cheapest, a good quality.  Spray it and get good coverage.  You could stop there, without having to add any other paint.  I'd prime it with a gray color and be done with it.  The weight from the paint will be very much negligible and won't affect the spinning action.  Also, I'd give it a good oiling, maybe even use grease vs. oil, to ensure a smooth spinning operation.  If you use grease, you may improve the operation of the cage better than when it was brand new.Good luck! <SEP> How would you preserve and paint and preserve a squirrel cage circulating fan for a furnace?

Here's the correct answer...for starters, don't use peanut butter... and for God's sake don't use acetone; it will ruin your paint-it's a paint removing solvent.

Then using a high pressure hose (like the kind they have at self-service car washes), blast it away.

A very very very fine steel wool, followed with a stainless steel polisher, buff it back to the original shine. This is what a dumb orangutan would do, so you may wish to.........start easier:QUOTEMany people are surprised to find that stainless steel can be stained. Cleaning stainless steel can sometimes seem tricky, but is a very resilient surface. When problems happen, it is best to start with the basics to help repair the surfaces.Baking soda mixed with liquid dish soap can make a good paste to gently rub on stains. Be sure to rinse the stainless steel surface thoroughly, and towel dry.If the stains still remain you can try vinegar. Remember to thoroughly rinse and towel dry.If stains still remain I recommend trying a stainless steel cleaner and polisher. Barkeeper's Friend is a good powder formula that can clean without scratching. Be sure to follow the directions, rinse thoroughly, and towel dry.

somewhat odd - but depending on what sort of flush (well -water input) mechanism your toilet uses - the solution might be simple.case 1 - look inside, you have a big float (copper or plastic) at the end of a bent rod. The water is turned on. Push the rod down no more than an inch at the float end. Did the water run and try to fill the tank? if so you're almost done. Hold at the pivot and at the float end bend the rod up CAREFULLY a bit at a time (1/4 inch stages) and when there's enough water to flush ok, you're done. Look out for where the handle fits into the tank, keep at least 3/4 inch below that for water level. And the rise and fall of the float itself, and rod, should not hit or tangle in anything.Case 2 - you can move the float up and down, water starts to run, but doesn't finish filling up the tank. TRy this - there may be a screw at the short (pivot) ent of the float (ball) arm. try turning it (only a quarter turn) counterclockwise, then gently push and pull the arm down and up again. maybe the valve was stuck.case 3- the valve will have to be replaced, kits are available, and cost no more that $20-$25 (CDN so cheaper in the US) plus Rona/Revy can give you a free pamphlet that explains how to do it much better than the Chinese instructions sheet you might get in the actual kit. PS, buy a flex hose to replace the supply line, the solids (copper or plastic) are awful. Spend the extra five bucks.case4 - call a plumber - who will charge $75 to show up (if and when they do) , plus parts and labor. $200 might be getting away easy.  I'd say - check out Revy or the local public library first...;case4 - you dont have an arm based float - just a plastic column. Look at the bit on top, and see whare it sits relative to the level of water in the tank. give it a small poke down, does more water flow? Column style valvesa are almost always plastic, and here you will want to buy a replacement, installation is a half hour job and a good DIY project - these valves are even easier than the lever/float to install and adjust.Good Luck!

Problem is filtration. To keep a pool clear and sparkling requires 3 things: CirculationFiltrationProper water chemistrySince you test the water daily the problem has to be one of circulation and filtration.

Magnetic Water Conditioners would be more like the correct term rather than water softeners.They work by keeping the particles in the water in suspension by altering their properties rather than actually removing them.This just prevents them from depositing Limescale on the pipes and in appliances apart from appliances which actually heats water to Boiling point.Boiling counteracts the magnetising effects of the conditioner. <SEP> how do magnetic water softners work? <EOS>

Ok First of all Most stain you need mineral Spirts to clean the brush out.Most of the stains and clear coat materials out on the market will say right on the front of the can WATER BASED.When it says this you clean it with warm water.Other then that you  need Min-Spi to clean the brush out.Next part of your question when you clean your brush out it does not need to be 100%dry but you need to get as much of the min-spi out you can do this by whipping it or placeing a dry rag down on a flat surface put the brush on it then fold the rag over and press down. Always remember when you clean a brush out no matter how good you do this 99% of the time after the brush dries out and when you go to use it again it will seem stiff all you need to do is brush your hand it will make the brush nice and soft again.PS- Always read the can before use. If you were to use Min-Spi on a water based stain the Brush can never be used again for water based again.A thing to remember just like with paint Latex paint you can always paint with latex or oil paint.But oil based paint you cant use latex on it.Once a brush or roller has been used for stain or oil thats all it could ever be used for again. But you could use a latex brush and go to oil but not back.And also the other answer that was givin if you were to use a brush and use it again 8 hours later you could rap it up but it would be better to put it in a can of Min-Spi this will make sure it dont dry up all all and all you need to do is whip it and dry it with the rag as good as you can.I have been in the field for 20 years and most people ruin brushes like this all the time. Read The can and Take your timeGoodluck <SEP> How to clean a brush that was used for staining? I was told to put the brush under water.  But it only became little gooey!

Most cans are now made of aluminium, these will not go red rusty as it is a nonferrous metal ( it contains no iron) it's surface when oxidising (going rusty) goes chalky.

To make it go rusty you could try scratching the surfaces all over and then leave it outside where the elements, ie wind and rain, can react with it <SEP> how can you rust metal? preferably sheets of steel you find from domestic tin cans <EOS>
Corian counter tops are made of material that is the same, all the way thru... so... to eliminate cuts, scratches, etc... some light sanding is all that is required.  You need to use a high grit sandpaper (180 or higher).I would follow up then, with a good buffing, with compound, to eliminate any really fine scratches, and restore the shine to the surface.  Check with your local home supply store, and they may have the products you need to work with. <SEP> how do you restore corian counter tops? <EOS>

Do you have an antique mirror that has silvering beyond redemption or has lost some of its silvering? You can have it resilvered, which is pretty expensive, or you can resilver it yourself, if you can find a kit, which is also pretty expensive and quite dangerous, or you can do it the quick and easy way. If there is just some silvering missing you won't need to remove the rest of it. If there are a few stains along with missing silvering, they add to the character of the piece. But, if you need to remove the old silver you can scrape the old silver off with a razor scraper (be sure it's a safe scraper and not just a razor blade) or remove it chemically. Be sure to dispose of the residue properly, because it will contain mercury and other dangerous elements. Also be sure to wear a dust mask if you scrape the old silver off. Next, you will need an inexpensive piece of 1/8" mirror large enough to put against the back of the original mirror. If the mirror is square or rectanglular the job is done. If the original mirror is shaped, then lay the original mirror on top of the new mirror and trace around the original mirror. If the mark is larger than the original mirror, be sure to remove the original mirror and reduce the size of the marked area so it will fit inside the rabbet of the frame. Next, using a glass cutter remove the excess mirror. If you haven't cut glass before, ask for some scrap pieces where you buy the mirror to practice on. If you aren't too successful with your glass cutting, then have the glass shop cut the shape for you. They will charge a fee which will be considerably less than resilvering or replacing a shaped, beveled mirror.If you are just interested in the process:First the old backing paints must be removed with paint stripper.  Then you remove the old silver with a special silver stripper.  Next the glass is polished with a red rouge.  Then a flux solution is put on the mirror so the new silver will stick to the glass.  Finally you mix the silver chemicals and POUR the silver onto the glass.  The mirror is then dried.  Two backing paints are then put on the back of the mirror and let dry. <SEP> how do you resilver a mirror? <EOS>

If the "backs" that you're refering to are removable cushions, there are a few options depending on how badly damaged they are. If you can remove the covers(zippers?), take out the inner cusion and discard the poly-batting(white cottony looking stuff). You can buy new batting by the yard or in packages at any fabric, craft, or upholstery shop. Re-wrap the old foam cushions in the new batting and put them back into the covers. If your foam is just too flat to save, you can purchase new foam at some fabric stores and upholstery shops also.If the "backs" are not removeable, and re-upholstering is out of the question, you could try to find a seam, open it buy carefully cutting the stitches, remove the old stuffing and re-stuff w/new material(batting). This might work but would probably be the least attractive option. <SEP> How do I make sofa cushions like new again?

If you are working with concrete you may want to start at the top of the hill and work downward.  This way gravity helps you pull the concrete into place.

The first thing you need to know is that unless you have spare tile from that exact dye lot, the chances of you matching the color of that tile is slim. Sometimes it is better to live with the cracked or chipped tile insted of replacing one that is much lighter or darker and stands out worse than a crack. If you are determined to replace the tile, get a grout removing tool or with a dremmel tool, a grout removing blade or bit, remove the grout from all four sides of the tile.

Hello mini-electrician:Basically, the 30 Amp 240 volt female has a corresponding male end that is made for that female. There should be a number on it.

The drive belt (or belts) of a washing machine may become worn or damaged, causing noisy operation or stopping the washer entirely. A damaged drive belt is easy to replace. Remove the back panel of the washer to gain access to the belt. To remove the belt:Step 1: Loosen the bolt on the motor bracket and move the motor to put slack in the belt.Step 2: Remove the old belt and stretch a new one into place on the pulleys.Step 3: To put tension on the new belt, use a hammer handle or a short pry bar to push the motor into position while you tighten the bolt in the adjustable bracket. The belt should have about 1/2 inch deflection when you press on it at the center point, midway between the pulleys. If the belt is too loose, it will slip on the pulleys, causing the machine to malfunction. If the belt is too tight, it will wear very quickly and will probably become so hot that it will start to smoke or smell.Loose pulleys can also cause problems. Most pulleys are fastened to shafts with setscrews around the hub of the pulley. These screws must be tight or else the pulley or belt will slip. The resulting malfunction may seem to be caused by a faulty motor, but it can be corrected by tightening the pulleys and adjusting the belt. For this reason, always check the belts and pulleys before working on the motor. <SEP> How do i replace the fan belt on a washing machine? Its too tight to go on!? <EOS>

Do you mean a veiwing sight?  If so, most security doors are just made of sheet metal with a hollow core.  Just mark the location of the hole  (check veiwer package for proper size), use a center or prick punch to dimple the spot, start the hole with a small (1/8") drill, then  select a metal cutting twist drill bit in the proper size, make very sure the  bit is stright level while finishing the hole.  From there it's just a matter of assembeling the veiwer following the instuctions that came with it.  The reason to use the 1/8" bit to start is two fold.  First  it is the best insurance to prevent the larger drill from moving offcenter and marring your door and also if you find that there are any supports or fireproof matrial unnder the sheet metal, it's much cheaper to break a small $1 drill bit than a larger one.  Any fireproofing material can be drilled with a carbide tipped masonary bit. <SEP> how do I install a door check on a securty door ???? <EOS>

You must have ventilation,  and if you have trapped air in the shed you won't stop the problem.
