HONEST ANSWERS.......Here goes.......Do you both rent? That would make things real simple. Being a Landlord myself, I know of what you speak.That's how they happen, a bathroom leak usually comes down in the downstairs living room, sometimes their small because if the drywall is solid or even new, water will actually sit in a puddle, depending on the size of the leak. First of all, go down there and tell him to show you the damage, usually the ceiling below the leak will be stained, kinda brown, from the drywall being wet. Before you do that,flush your toilet,make sure everything is quiet, listen for running water or drips. That kind of damage can be real bad,if there is water, it will soak the drywall, eventually it could all come down. Like I said in the beginning, if you both rent, it's the landlords problem, if he owns the house, make sure you see it, if you can't do it, get someone YOU KNOW to take care of it.......Hit Answers up again, I'll be looking for you.

You need to jack up the car and remove the wheel, make sure you use good jack stands to support the weight of the van. Next use a c-clamp from the outside pad to the back of the caliper and compress the caliper.Then remove the lower caliper bolt and swing the caliper upwards away from the rotor. replace the pads and reinsert the caliper and bolt. Make sure before moving the car you pump the brake pedal until firm. Then you need to Burnish the new braking surface after the brake pads have been replaced. Burnish the new braking surface by making 20 stops from 30 mph. Use medium to firm pressure on the brake pedal. Do not overheat the brakes.<SEP>how to change brake pads on 2000 chevy venture?<EOS>
Typically you don't fix a heater core, you simply replace it.The heater core is in the passenger compartment usually along the center of the dashboard behind the temperature adjustment/fan controls. You'll have to disassemble the interior to get to it. Either the dash board from the top or from either the passenger or driver side from below.It basically looks like a mini radiator and pokes through the fire wall. You'll need a specialized tool to disconnect the clamps the hold the heater core to the hoses that draw in the water into the heater core.<SEP>how to fix a heater cord in a 1993 Ford Aerostar?<EOS>

Don't know the year and make of your car, but there are usually some service recommendations in your owners manual.  Always start there and see what things haven't been tended to in a while.Could be filters, tire pressure, spark plugs, correct warm-up times, etc.  Put some things on your calender when to do next.Next, take extra weight out of the car; some people drive around with at least an extra hundred pounds in the car.Trying for the "smooth driver award" is the best way to describe good gas mileage driving, no rapid starts, anticipating stoplights, etc.Leaving just a few minutes early for each trip gives you the option of not speeding, and the added benefit of being a safer driver.  Going faster  really burns lots of gas.Lastly, if you have a fuel injected car, you can turn off your engine for stops of over one minute.These steps can easily take in-town mileage from 15mpg to 20mpg, decreasing gas consumption and gas bills by 25%.<SEP>How do I improve my Gas mileage?<EOS>

Try here:  http://www.ehow.com/how_17787_remove-super-glue.htmlSuperglue (cyanoacrylate) has many uses. Besides the typical household function of sticking things together, it's used in surgical procedures and even in crime labs to develop unseen fingerprints. Originally marketed as Eastman #910 in 1958, this stuff is sneaky and it goes everywhere if you don't keep an eye on it.          Steps:  1.   Clean up any glue that is still wet by blotting it with a white paper towel or terry cloth towel.    2.   Soak the object in warm soapy water if possible and try rubbing off as much as you can.    3.   Pour a little bit of acetone-base nail polish remover on a white terry cloth.    4.   Dab at the dried glue until it dissolves.    5.   Use extra fine sandpaper to remove dried glue from the surface of an object.    6.   Try a product called Goof-Off or Z-7 Debonder.        Tips:   Hold a folded white cloth on the back of fabrics to keep the acetone from soaking through other layers.     Acetone may affect colors or melt plastic fibers, such as some nylons or carpet. Test it on a hidden area first.        Warnings:   Don't use solvents such as gasoline or paint thinner.<SEP>How can I get super glue off the carpet?<EOS>

The same spiral balances have been used in the window industry for many years.  They are notorious for the type of problems you describe.  Replacements are readily available and are fairly cheap.Remove one of the failed balances and take it to any glass repair shop.  Many of them will deep an assortment of the balances in stock.  If not, they can order you the same balance.  They will probably cost you about $15.00 apiece.  Check the other windows in your house.  It could be that you have a window with the same size spiral balance that you rarely open.  If so, you might want to swap the balances and save some money.  Eventually you will likely have to buy some replacements.Good luck with your problem.<SEP>How to repair 18-20 yr.old single-pane windows w/ spiral rods on both sides of sash that won't stay open?

How can I make some data on a Google Spreadsheet auto-sorting?<SEP>It is also possible to use Google Apps Scripts to achieve automatic in-place sorting of the data.  This may be more difficult to achieve and more error-prone (I'd still go for William Jackson's solution, +1 BTW), but I thought it was interesting enough to show.  I have a sheet that looks like this:   I added a new script, using these steps:   in the menu, go to Tools -> Script Editor...  select Create a new project  in the empty code window that appears, paste the following code, which will be run automatically whenever a cell is edited:  function onEdit(event){   var sheet = event.source.getActiveSheet();   var editedCell = sheet.getActiveCell();    var columnToSortBy = 4;   var tableRange = "B3:E9";    if(editedCell.getColumn() == columnToSortBy){        var range = sheet.getRange(tableRange);     range.sort( { column : columnToSortBy } );   } }  go back to the sheet and start playing around with the values to see the table sort automatically each time   Note:  In the above script,   the value 4 represents the index of column D (the Value column - the on that's going to be sorted)  the value "B3:E9" represents the table range (excluding the header row)   Your table will most likely differ from mine, so these values should be adjusted accordingly.<EOS>

Your problem is the main drain and NOT the P-Trap. If it was only the P-trap then the neighbor wouldn't be having a problem. Both your drains may meet behind the wall before they go into the drain pipe. If that's the case there may be a problem behind the wall and that is the landlords problem. Unless you want what you dropped down I wouldn't worry about taking apart your p-trap. The landlord should send someone to the roof to drop a snake down the drain vent and remove the clog. Should you want to remove the p-trap you will need an adjustable wrench to remove the two nuts that hold it in place. You may want to go to a home store or plumbers shop and buy another p-trap if it looks nasty because it might fall apart when you try to remove the nuts. You will need an 11/2" for the kitchen and 1 1/4 for a bathroom. BE AWARE THAT WHEN YOU REMOVE IT ALL THE WATER THAT IS BACKED UP INTO THE DRAIN PIPE IS GOING TO START GUSHING OUT OF THE PIPE.

I live upstairs & the lady in  the apt. next to me is having problems with hers also, (I assuume because we share a common pipe, which is past our seperate drains. According to our leases we are responsible for the plumbing bill if we caused the problem!! Neither she nor I can afford large plumbing expense.  I was told by a friend that since the trap is metal (galvinized) it would be easy to repacel due to the fact that it is not only clogged but  also probably quite corroded.  She informed me that it  not a difficutl task  you just must use caution !!I understand, with that said, her son was going to try to use a "Shop Vac" & plastic tubing to try to suck out the objects down there. but I don't know if that would be sufficient ,because I believe some has gone past the trap!!!<EOS>

Shallow scratches can be hidden by using a leather conditioner.  Deeper scratches can only be fixed by a pro($79.00 -89.00), they have the kits that will fill in and blend the color.

I am a Construction Superintendent and I'm here too help.  First I want to say that there is no such thing as a perfectly built home.  If there was, you couldn't afford it.  With that said, you need to send a punchlist, in writing, certified mail to your builder.  Give the builder a reasonable amount of time to make the repairs.  More than likely, the builder used a Masonry sub-contractor.  Try to find out who that is.If the builder and/or the contractor do not address your issues in reasonable time then you simply go to your town hall and look for the Code Official or Construction Office.  I have seen firsthand, almost immediate results when the Code Officials get involved.  They know all of the builders and they should be able to help out.Most builders allow one year for punchlist items, settling cracks and the like.  Give this a try.<SEP>How do I get the builder to fix problems in my new home that they promised to fix?

Umm, it weighs the same at any speed.What you may be referring to is the forces on the con rod and crank/bearings, which has little to do with centrifugal force :-) You're looking at a linear braking and acceleration, at each end of the piston travel, so you'd need to know how fast it's traveling up and down the bore... except that's not linear, since the crank is offet, so the piston speed varies over the length of it's travel.You might want to try laying out a series of 1:1 drawings to get the dimensions involved,  then go from there<SEP>How do you figure the weight of an engine piston at a certain RPM?

You can throw on a new intake and some new pipes out the back.  Improved air flow in and out of the engine will always do the trick.  An aftermarket computer programmer will also take care of the fuel curve, but while it adds more horsepower, you will lose a mile or two per gallon.  They're incredibly easy to use anymore...they just plug into your diagnostic port, which is normally under the dashboard.  If you want even more, you can add a larger bore throttle body.  Again, this will require a bit more fuel so that the ngine doesn't lean out, but your programmer should take that into account and will take care of that.  You could go on forever with upgrades and aftermarket stuff, but they're typically the cheapest and best start.  Check out http://www.summitracing.com/.  you should get yourself one of their catalogs.  I'm almost positive they're free, and it's the best bathroom reading ever printed.

Could be a problem thermostat.  Could also be a gas flow issue, meaning one or more of the gas exhaust vents has become clogged (e.g., with burned food) thereby limiting the total gas into the oven, which would limit the maximum temperature the oven could reach.To answer your main question, your oven works just like your home heating--a thermocouple/thermostat determines the temperature it is, and depending on the temperature you want, it lets gas flow or not (usually full on or full off).  The gas burns due to the pilot light.<SEP>How does the temperature contol work on a gas oven?

Problem is filtration. To keep a pool clear and sparkling requires 3 things: CirculationFiltrationProper water chemistrySince you test the water daily the problem has to be one of circulation and filtration. To be frank, the filter systems that come with those pools are a disgrace. To even begin to keep the pool clear they must be operated 24/7. But if you run them that long the life expectancy of the pumps is shortened dramatically. Sorry, but there is no substitute for a quality filter/pump. Wish I had better news.

Im A plumber so here is you answer.Its hard to answer You didnt say where it was leaking.A quick run down You have a fill valve/  Douglas Valve/Flapper/Tank to bowl gasket with bolts and a wax ring with or without horn.1st dry off the WC (water closet=Toilet) and try to find out where the water is from2nd if its on the floor then its is the wax ring. Remove the supply line and bolts and replace the wax ring. if its where the bowl and tank meet then its the tank to bowl gasket set (3.99 Home depot) Remove bolts and gasket and replace. TIP when putting the new bolts on use plumbers dope on rubber washers to make a good seal also put Dope on gasket and tank and bowl for good seal. If its from there area where the supply line is going in thats the fill valve. Most WC have a valve with a rod and long ball on the end. DO not replace it with the same one Go to Home depot and Get A fluid master 400a And replace. And supply line check connections if bad then replace.3 other things could be a hair line crack in tank or bowl.also the flapper. inside the WC best way to check use some food coloring from the kitchen put 5 or so drops in the tank stir up a bit in 20 min or so if you used red and the water in the bowl is red then flapper is bad but this could also mean The seal or unit its on is bad. Replace. (this is also a good thing to do at 1st use the color red or blue and where you see it is where the problem is.but last WC= will sweet the temp of the water and the temp outside if there is a certain change it will sweet. You can fix it will a liner in the tank.

Lets not run to re-wire so fast.  A grounded system is a great idea.

You don't have to remove the whole rack. Remove the wheel. Undo the tie rod end and leave the nut on 6 or 7 threads. Take a heavy hammer and strike the eye of the ball pin several times to release the taper.(this is why you left the nut on so if the hammer missed it would not damage the ball pin threads) Now, lift the tie rod end out of the steering arm and undo the adjusting lock nut on the tie rod end and screw it off, noting the number of turns, also remove the lock nut. R & R the new boot and refit the lock nut and tie rod end the same number of turns,(this avoids a wheel alighnment) tighten the locknut and refit the tie rod end to the steering arm and replacee the wheel.

A few things leap to mind. First, gas in the oil is very bad. It thins the oil to the point where it is no longer lubricating the engine, and your engine will self-destruct if you run it. Second, what you now have in your engine is an explosive vapor. It can explode, or at least ignite. Third, well, there is no third, since the first two are enough to ruin your day. The problem often occurs when a mechanical fuel pump driven off the camshaft develops some kind of leak and pumps gas into the crankcase. I used to work for a VW mechanic, and I fixed this problem several times, including the part about draining rather explosive oil from the engine. It can also occur if your carburetor or fuel injection system has a problem like a stuck float needle or some other problem that is allowing fuel to be dumped into the engine. If you do not get it fixed, you will not have to worry about checking the oil, at least not in this car. Maybe the one you replace it with, but not this one.<SEP>How do I keep gasoline from leaking in to my oil?

When you ran out of gas, it is highly likely that the fuel pump sucked something into it that was sitting in your gas tank and either damaged your fuel pump, or clogged the filter if you've got a fuel pump inside the tank.If your fuel pump is out side the tank. First thing is change out the fuel filter. Hopefully the filter prevented the junk from the tank from moving further down.If your fuel pump is inside the tank, try a bottle of fuel injector cleaner down the tank. Be smart, don't run out of gas. Bad for the pump, bad for the filter, and of course bad for the car.<SEP>how do i tell if the gas in my vehicle is bad? it is sputtering and bogging out since i ran out of gas and filled it with gas in a geri can.<EOS>

glazing is installing. you can take out the old piece of glass using a putty knife to cut through any glue or silicone. be sure to get all the broken pieces out before putting the new one in. then run a bead of clear silicone against your frame. put the piece of glass in and press to seal against the silicone. then run plastic glazing bead around the outside edege. or wood depending on the frame. if you can't find any glazing bead then put another thicker bead of silicone over the outside of the glass. you will have "glazed" the window. if the window is putty glazed, you can buy that at the hardware store also. 33 glazing putty works well. but any putty can be a tough job. so depending on how easy you want it or the type of frame its in, any way you go, silicone will seal the unit in place. you can use a silicone latex blend if you want to paint over it later.<SEP>how do you re-glaze a window.is caulk the same as glaze?<EOS>

How can I download all messages from Facebook?<SEP>To start, use a computer and open the Google Chrome browser. If you don’t have Google Chrome, then download it. Then use the Google Chrome browser to go to http://m.facebook.com/messages/  Then click the person you want to see the first message with.  Now press Ctrl + Shift + J and then paste this code into the lower window that pops up, and then press Enter . It will then proceed to load old messages until it reaches the very first message. Here is the code:  setInterval(function () { document.getElementById('see_older') .getElementsByClassName('content')[0].click(); }, 500);  The above code can also be found on this website: http://jsfiddle.net/magicramki/k9gda3cu/  If you do not want to go back all the way, you will need to stop the script. In order to do that, you will first need to define it as a variable:  var myVar=setInterval(function () { document.getElementById('see_older') .getElementsByClassName('content')[0].click(); }, 500);  Then to stop it, you will simply need to enter the following command:  window.clearInterval(myVar)  You can resume the script anytime by typing the first part again.  Now once it loads everything, you have two options. You can right click anywhere on the page and choose "save as" and then save that file somewhere on your computer. Then use Google Chrome to open it when you want to view it later (won't look right in Internet Explorer). This will save the entire chat, complete with pictures and emoticons. When you want to search for a particular day, press Ctrl + F to bring up the find box. Then type in "Mar 2", for example, to bring up the conversation on March 2nd.  The second option is to highlight the parts that you want to save, and then copy by pressing Ctrl + C . Then open Microsoft Word and paste that into the document by pressing Ctrl + V . Now save that file. This will save the text and pictures, but not the emoticons.<EOS>

First thing you should do is setup your filter.. make sure it's running correctly.Next, vacuum the bottom of your pool and skim the debris off the top.Add lots of chlorine. I get a 5 gallon barrel from my local supplier. Add a bottle of Algaecide concentrate (R60). Run your filter continuously for several days. Your sand filter will require frequent backwashing. The frequency of how often you backwash depends on the filter pressure. The pressure gage on your sand filter will increase as it removes particulate from the water.  On mine, when it reaches around 17-20, I know that it needs a good backwashing.<SEP>how do you open your swimming pool?  My water is really dirty I cannot see the bottom? We have a sand filter?<EOS>

inline 6's are pretty good. with a few mods, you can make that straight 6 compete with the v8's. But for your question...need to know a few things.

you first nedd to assess the condition of the bodywork, does the paint have any bubbles ? is there any corrosion that needs repairing such as wheel areches etc ( you dont say what the vehicle is and the age) asuming there is no serious corrosion then you have a lot of sanding to do, if the paintwork and bodywork is in good condition then you need to basically take the shine off the paintwork and ideally coat it with etch primer, the trouble is not knowing what the paint is on the vehicle as some modern paints react with older ones, if this is the case you will need to go back to bare metal to cure the bubbling effect this has, the process is not complicated but it is time consuming, from bare metal you would using body filler (mix in proportions of  filler = size of a golf ball, hardner = size of a pea) you apply the filler to the damaged area and allow to set hard, using as fine a grade of production paper as posssible (less scratches to get rid of later) you sand the repait until it is flat with the panel surface (ifi its curved use something like a piece of plastic pipe, if flat use a rubbing block) you keep repeating this process until the repair is unoticble when you run your hand over it, all repairs must be as good as that.  Next you prime the area using a fine dust coat so that and high or low spots can be seen and repaired this can be done by using a filler putty, this coat needs to be rubbed down with wet and dry (use soap as well it stops the paper clogging) and this process is repeated until all the repairs are complete, then if you wish you can begin applying coats of primer rubbing down with a fine paper in between (soap again) and finally panel wipe (solvent so take care) and tak rag the surface ready for painting, i reccomend several coats of primer to give a deep finish<SEP>How do I prep a car for spraying?

The plan was to create an 8" wide ditch (8" to 10" deep) along the perimeter and fill with gravel and corrugated 4" drain pipe. There is a "cloth wrap" available that installs over the pipe to prevent dirt and debris from ever clogging the pipe perferations. Once the pitch is established the pipes will be directed into the sump pump basin. The sump basin is a standard "sump pump basin" from Lowes or Home Depot with a 1/2hp pump with float auto-activation.When everything is put into place, I will back-fill with more gravel and then patch trench with cement leaving a 1/2 inch gap along the wall for any water from the walls to drain in to.I need help on the proper tools and prep work as well as supplies to use.<EOS>
Well Im a Plumber and you have a problem.Lets start with the water 1st Check near the unit in the bathroom there should be a valve at every unit. But this is not always the case. If not go to your basement or where the main unit is and look for the shut off there. The only thing is Most of the valves have not been turned off in 30yrs and they dont close all the way or they close but wont open again. Now for the pipe. Well No easy way to say this It needs to be replaced.There are lil fixes you can try They have lil clamps with rubber on the inside of the clamp you put it over the pipe and tighten up. But no matter what you do this is only a quick fix. The problem with solder is it dont work with water and also if the pipe is bad there is a 95% chance that the whole pc is bad. This is not a easy thing to fix though.I would suggest to call A Plumber not just anyone Call someone that works on these kind of units. I have seen some really bad jobs by plumbers that think they can fix anything that moves water and made it 10times worse.
