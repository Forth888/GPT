A squeaky noise may indicate a loose fanbelt or a fanbelt encountering too much resistance.In this case the sound will be like: Whinnninnninnninnnn!!!If you have a serpentine belt (a belt that winds around engine components like a snake), you don't necessarily have to replace it. It may be just loose. Snug it up. There will be an adjusting bolt somewhere most likely near the alternator. Buy a Haynes manual for your car at an Autozone ($12.00). It will show you exactly where the bolt is if you can't find it.If you have one belt that wraps around the crankshaft pulley, the air conditioner compressor, and the alternator(a more simpler setup to the serpentine), there will be an adjusting bolt right in front of the alternator. Snug it up if the belt is loose.Does it happen when you are steering? Turn the car on and steer the wheel lock to lock. If you hear a whining sound, you need power steering fluid. Un cap the reservoir and fill it. The Haynes manual will show you where it is.Does the problem only occur when the AC is on? Switch it on and off with the engine running. It it comes and goes, and the belt is not loose, your AC compressor needs oil. Buy a can of R134a AC gas with compressor lubricant and inject it into the input port. The port looks like a tire valve at the top of one of your AC lines. Again, your Haynes manual and the directions with the R134a can will tell you the details.Good Luck! This should only cost you around $20-25 including the manual cost.<SEP>How do you know when your fan belt needs changing? My car (2001 Saturn SL-2) just stalled and wouldn't start for a few minutes.  When it finally started up, the brakes were stiff and it would rumble before it finally get some gas and go.  There was also a squeaky sound as I was driving.  This same problem occurred in Flagstaff while I was up there going to school.  I figured it was the cold weather, but I'm now in southern AZ and there's no cold weather going on here.<EOS>

I've got to agree with the filler option .I too have to fill drilled holes in both white and brown PVC fittings etc. Remove any raised edges around the screw hole with a countersink bit held in your hand..just twirl it enough to clear the rough edges of screw hole.Apply filler...good quality Silicone is the favourite...some of the Acrylics are varying quality so go with the Silicones..If you apply it carefully you can get a good result.

I have faced the same problem.  Rent or buy a pressure washer.  It will quickly remove the mildew and dirt build up.  You will be amazed at how good your concrete walks will look.  The only problem is that the mildew will return over time.  Of course you cannot change the climate in which you live, but you can take some steps to minimize the reoccurance.  Mildew likes damp and shady areas that are not subject to constant drying winds.  Trimming trees and shrubs to expose the walks to sunlight will help.  Correcting drainage problems will also help.  If none of these options are available, consider the purchase of a pressure washer.  An electric homeowners model can be had for under $150.00.  You can then keep the mildew at bay as needed.With all due respect to the other people who have answered this question, bleach is not a good solution.  It is messy, smells bad, and is harmful to your landscaping.  It is also a temporary fix since rain water simply rinses it away over time.  It can also stain your concrete if applied too strong.Good luck with your mildew problem.<SEP>how do you get mildew off a concrete walkway?<EOS>

MeetingWizard meets criteria 1,2,4 and 5.  I think it meets criteria 3 "copy and paste list of email addresses".  An address book is maintained within the application.  Rather than tediously entering each address in the address book, go directly to "Create a meeting request".  Propose one or more dates and times.  On the next "Meeting Event Details" screen, paste your list of email addresses, one address per line or separate with a  comma, to a maximum of 50.  Select the "Add all new addresses to Address Book" box, to eliminate entering the addresses the next time.  I recently implemented this for a local community band.  Many of the musicians are not comfortable using computers, so the two click response without the need for a login was excellent.  The response rate 75%+ greatly exceeded what we were getting with just email.   It has lots of features which came in handy eg reminders to non-responders, adding additional details, printing lists of people attending etc.  The price is great; free.

If you have a basement, or a crawl-space, you can drill screws from underneath (being careful not to use too long of a screw) through your subfloor to prevent the floorboard from moving.  This is a good cure, but, should only be used as a last resort because things can go wrong in a hurry if not done right.  Make sure you can determine how thick the plywood/subfloor under your hardwood is, and the hardwood itself, and use a considerably shorter screw then the total thickness.  You do NOT have to go into the hardwood, simply up to it so it does not move anymore.  You may have to use several screws for each spot. Have somebody up above making it squeak, it makes it alot easier to find and fix the spots.  Hope this helps, it's worked for me.

SEARCH SITES HAD 2 THAT LOOKED RIGHT.  YOU CAN'T VACUUM SALT THATS BEEN DISOLVED IN WATER AND IMPREGNATING THE FIBERS OF CLOTH OR PILE. IF ITS GRAINS OF SALT, YES, YOU CAN. YOU HAVE TO GET IT UP BY DISOLVING IT IN WATER THEN REMOVE THE WATER WITH A "WET OR DRY" VAC OR TOWEL. YOU HAVE TO DO IT REPEATEDLY UNTIL YOU HAVE REMOVED A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF IT. DO A LARGE AMOUNT OF  WATER THEN GET IT AS DRY AS YOU CAN. MY GUESS IS DO THAT 4 OR 5 TIMES MINIMUM.FROM WIKIPEDIAhttp://wiki.ehow.com/Get-Salt-Stains-out-of-Your-Car's-CarpetHome   >   Categories   >   Cars How to Get Salt Stains out of Your Car's CarpetIf you drive in a cold climate, you'll very likely end up with white stains on your car's carpeting from road salt. Fortunately it's easy, if a little repetitive, to get the stains out. Here's how. Steps In a spray bottle, mix up a solution of 1/2 warm water and 1/2 white vinegar. Spray the stained area with the solution. Press a dry terrycloth towel over the wet area. Remove the towel when it's soaked. Repeat until the stains are gone. Tips If you don't want to spend a whole day doing this, apply the solution whenever you happen to be driving. Just remember to remove the towel promptly and let the carpet dry out. Don't be discouraged by a deep-rooted stain. It will come out eventually. Warnings Avoid the temptation to rub the stained area.

Do you have central air conditioning combined with your furnace?  If not, there may not be a condensate drain.   The condensation is a by-product of running the Air Conditioning.Often, the inside "coil" of the AC is located in the larged duct area between your furnace and the ducting that proceeds into your living areas.  So, a furnace in the basement, typically sees the AC coil above the furnace.  Look for tubes that travel from that unit to the box that sits outside.  One of the tubes goes down instead.  it could be a white colored PCV pipe, clear tubing, etc.   Drips of water will travel this tube to drain into a floor drain near the furnace or into a condensate pump (about the size of a shoe box).  This pump will push the water up another tube to the nearest drain -- perhaps a basement washtub sink.Good luck.<SEP>How do I find the condensate drain on my furnace?

Great automotive questionBut that's a problem that's extremely difficult to solve, at least on a permanent basis.It's caused by the growth of fungi in the ac evaparator case, manufactuers have been faced with this complaint for years. Especially in geographic regions with high humidity and temperatures.There are numerous products on the market that propose to eliminate the odor, but I've never seen one that permanately resolves the smell. Usually they will work for a short period of time and the smell reappears.Most dealerships and some auto repair shops will have a chemical and special tool that is sprayed inside the evaporator core to slow down this fungi growth, and hopefully stop the smell.You may be able to purchase similar products at your local parts house as well, it should come with instructions on how to use.One Important tip--------Using your ac on outside air on a frequent basis will help slow down this condition to some degree. The outside air keeps moisture from building up in the evaporator case, thus preventing the growth of fungi.It will also help the evap case dry if you turn your ac mode on "outside air" before shutting off the engine for long periods of time.Jerry Christopherhttp://www.usedcarwise.com<SEP>How can I get rid of the musty smell coming out of my cars AC.?<EOS>

When I had them there wasn't much of a body count to be honest and the guy from pest control said that's normal enough cos they take the poison back to their nest and they all die there. Are you sure they are still alive? I'd carry on putting the poison down cos they are taking it and it will eventually kill them. Traps are useful too. Or even get a cat or dog - tho that's a bit drastic if you don't want a pet! Good luck I know how horrible it is but they will die in the end. Carry on doing what you're doing. The poison works on a body weight for weight basis so if there are quite a few of them it will take a while to kill them all off.<SEP>How can i get rid of the mice in my house?

Remove the inner tube, by removing the wheel from the bicycle. Ensure the inner tube is fully deflated by pressing on the pin inside the valve. Remove the inner tube from the tyres using tyres levers failing that spoon handles also work well. Never use anything sharp. Try to determine the cause if the puncture. There may be a thorn or piece of glass embedded in the tyre. Run your hand gently inside the tyre to check if there is something sharp. Remove if you find this with say a screwdriver. Alternatively check if a spoke is pushing through, ensure the tape inside the rim is sitting properly. Inflate the tyre using a pump and fill a bowl with water and check if any bubbles escape. If they are escaping from teh valve you will need a new inner tube. If however they are escaping from a hole in the rubber remove the inner tube and dry this area, deflate the inner tube. In your bicycle repair kit you will have a tube of rubber solution and a piece of rubber. Spread rubber solution on the area around the hole with rubber solution covering an area just wider than the rubber patch. Leave about 5minutes to dry. Check the rubber solution should be tacky. Peel off the backing of your rubber strip and apply that previously coated side to the rubber solution. To avoid air bubbles forming press from the center outwards. Once satisfied, grate and dust some chalk powder to prevent any extra rubber solution to sticking to your tyre. Leave another few minutes before gently pumping up the inner tube again about half pressure. Check the hole is now fixed by placing under water again. If all is well then deflate position carefully inside the tyre and inflate to full pressure. Replace and tighten the wheel. You should now be ready to ride again.<SEP>How do you repair a bicycle puncture? I have all the tools and a spare inner tube just in case but have only got as far as taking my wheel off!<EOS>

10:1 water to bleach will clean it. If it is surface mold you're okay. If it is in the drywall, you have to replace the drywall. If it is on the wood, it is most likely just surface mold. Use a full breathing mask, with noxious filters when you are removing that stuff. If you have a lot you will want to seal off the rest of the house when removing drywall. Please fix the problem, before you finish. If the mold is on the outside walls, then you need to reduce the humidity and insulate the walls to bring the temperature up so the water is not condensing on the surface.<SEP>how to remove mold in home?<EOS>

Takes 3 things to keep a pool clear and sparkling: 1) Circulation2) Filtration3) Proper water chemistry.Correct all 3 of these and the pool will respond. How long do you run the pump each day?

Not quite sure what you are asking-but here goes.HVAC systems can contribute to poor indoor air quality.#1.It is a moist, dark environment that is prime place for mold growth.#2.It merely recycles the air in the structure-it does not bring in fresh air.#3.The "filter" does little more than take out the big particles in the air.These particles are dead skin flakes,dust mites,insect parts,etc....The filter does not remove or kill bacteria,volatile organic compounds (formaldehyde,solvents,benzene)The filter just traps things on it so mold spores have something to feed on.The list goes on,but this should be a start.I could tell you more if you're interested.<SEP>how can HVAC systems be corrolated to IAQ?<EOS>

Wow, this has happened to me before!  Actually more than once!First, don't run any water or anything down the drain.  The contact might be already gone, but there's a possibility that it's still in the P-trap underneath the sink.  If you put anything down the sink there's a possibility that it might wash out into the pipes and be lost..The P-trap is the curved pipe you see underneath the sink.  Disconnect the P-trap underneath the sink.  First, put something under there to catch the water that will fall out when you disconnect it.  The P-trap is usually held onto the pipes with some rings.  All you have to do is unscrew the rings.  You might need to use a pliers or vice grip to do this.  After you unscrew the rings, just slide the P-trap off the pipe, and dump the water from the P-trap into your bucket or whatever.  Examine this water for your contact lens.Also, sometimes the contact can get stuck to the pipe inside the sink.  There's gunk on there that the contact will sometimes stick to.  So if you don't find it in the P-trap, check the pipe that goes from the sink to the P-trap.  If the contact is in there, you can dislodge it with a long tool (a stick, pencil, whatever).If it's not in that pipe or the P-trap, you probably won't get it back.  Also, if you're not completely sure that it went into the sink, check the floor and other surfaces in the bathroom.  Sometimes it can seem like they fell in there when they really fell somewhere else.  If you shine a flashlight around it makes it easier to locate the contact because it will reflect the light from the flashlight.  You can see the glint of the light off the contact and that's how you'll know where it is.If you find your contact, of course, you will want to clean the contact lens thoroughly before putting it back into your eye.I hope you find it!<SEP>How do I retreive a lost hard contac lens from the sink drain?<EOS>

There's absolutely no reason not to refinish and continue to use it, provided the rust isn't excessive to the point that blades are deteriorating.  Paint on some rust gel, the chemical reaction turns the rust into a stable material.  You can paint it on without removing the blades probably.  Follow directions on the gel.  You'll probably have to hose the cage off as a last step.  Then get a good quality primer in a spray can - not the cheapest, a good quality.  Spray it and get good coverage.  You could stop there, without having to add any other paint.  I'd prime it with a gray color and be done with it.  The weight from the paint will be very much negligible and won't affect the spinning action.  Also, I'd give it a good oiling, maybe even use grease vs. oil, to ensure a smooth spinning operation.  If you use grease, you may improve the operation of the cage better than when it was brand new.Good luck!<SEP>How would you preserve and paint and preserve a squirrel cage circulating fan for a furnace?

Some people prefer to use a sprayer (like a garden sprayer) because its easier to stain the ballusters but you can end up wasting a lot of stain that way and also cause puddles on the decking. Use a brush or roller and apply just like you would paint. If you are re-staining, ideally you'd want to take a pressure washer to it but if you don't have one, give it a good scrub with a stiff bristle or wire brush. Make sure to THOROUGHLY stir the stain, and stir it every 10-15 minutes otherwise some of the stain will be like water and the bottom will be thicker than paint.<SEP>how do you stain a deck?<EOS>

Materials & Tools:Knife, 6 or 8 drywall screws or other flat headed (countersunk) screws, screw driver, 2 wooden paint stirrers or a wooden yardstick, duct tape, simple white glue,  some spackling or drywall compound, putty knife (or spatula), sandpaper, 6 pack of beer, paint, a framed mirror, picture, or print.if the broken dry wall is still in place or punched into the wall cavity, carefully remove it. Cut out the broken material carefully - trying to keep it in one piece or attached to the backing paper -  and save it. You're going to reuse it.Get a couple of wooden strips or thin boards that are long enough to cross the hole. Wooden paint stirrers (free) or wooden yard stick cut down to size will work. so would a wooden ruler.place one of the sticks into the wall cavity so that it traverses the hole. Hold it up against the back side of the existing wallboard and secure it with a screw on each end. You're screwing through the wall and into the wooden strip behind the wall. Repeat with the other strip so you have  2 strips crossing the hole. This is the structure to which you will attach the broken piece. If the hole is small enough or the wooden strip wide enough - only one may be required.put the broken pieces of wall on the floor FACE DOWN and assemble them in their orignial configuration like a puzzle. Use the Duct Tape to hold them together if necessary. Flip the assembly over, and glue any partial pieces on to fill in any holes, trying to achieve a relatively flat wall surface.put the reassembled wall section into the hole, securing it to the strips with either a couple of screws, or glue if the wall section is too broken up to get a screw into. all the screws should be screwed in far enough to leave a little indention. sparingly smooth on the spackling or drywall compound with a putty knife (or spatula), just filling in the cracks and the screw holes. Try to preserve as much of the original wall texture as possible - it's hard to replicate.If you don't have spakling or joint compound, use the white glue. to fill in indentions (like those made by the screws, don't try to fill it in all at once. do one layer, drink a beer while it drys, then repeat.don't worry about glue not drying flat. Sand off the excess joint compound or glue to get a flat surface.Paint and hang a picture over it. Drink the rest of your beer and resolve to not make any more holes in the wall.<SEP>How would one repair a cantaloupe sized hole in drywall in a discreet fashion with rather limited supplies?

I like to use carnuba car wax.  Since your furniture will be exposed to the same elements as your car, the auto wax will give the bamboo the same protection against the sun and rain.  It doesn't hurt the wood, gives it a nice shine that will bead up water but on really light areas it may darken the bamboo.  Depending on how exposed your bar is to the elements, particularly sun which makes it brittle over time, you will have to treat it about every 6 months.  But, you can test that by dropping water on it to see if it still beads.  You can also use regular furniture wax or butcher's wax, but it simply doesn't last as long outside.<SEP>How to treat bamboo?
