danknow is right, it depends on the tank design.  I too worked in a gas station and had to dip tanks, but there we knew the size of the tank and were able to use the right chart with the right stick.

If you used an oil base stain you can use an oil based top coat or a water base top coat. Look for "Gloss" on the can.please note: wait ATLEAST 24 hours to apply a water base top coat to an oil based stain!If you used a water based stain, ONLY use a water based top coat!!Generally, 3 coats of a top coat will do a great job in "sealing" your project. Remember to sand in between coats with 400 to 600 gritt sand paper (after the top coat has dried). VERY LIGHT sanding is needed in between coats, FOLLOW THE WOOD GRAIN as much as possible, look for a "white dust like" and then move on to a different area. Wipe the white dust off with a paper towel before your next coat. After the final coat just rub out the finish with a piece of paper.

The first thing you need to know is that unless you have spare tile from that exact dye lot, the chances of you matching the color of that tile is slim.

I'm not sure if what I've encountered is the same as you are asking about, but here goes.On older basement windows, metal sash, the glass is held in by spring clips that are roughly in the shape of a capital "A"Lower legs of the "A" fit either into holes in the sash that are pre-drilled for them, or are squeezed into elongated slots. Often the holes are hidden by a residue of old putty.The glass is placed into the sash on a bedding of glazing putty, springs are inserted to hold it in place, and then more putty is tooled onto the edges, covering the springs. The putty serves to prevent breakage from vibration and to provide an air seal.If you have some other design, add it in details and I'll see what I can do.<SEP>how  does the spring clip go into the frame of a metal casement window when replacing the glass?<EOS>

Thoroughly clean the deck using a pressure washer or stiff bristle brush, allow to dry. Unlike the other poster, I disagree about using a sprayer to apply the sealer.

I just did some repairs to some lath and plaster this morning. You need to pick off any "loose" pieces at the edges of your existing hole. Your 1 foot by 3 foot repair may become larger! It's tough to know when to stop. When you feel you have removed the most loose pieces, it's time to start the repair. You need to purchase some "setting type" joint compound. It comes in a powder that you add water to, and mix to a consistancy that is slightly thinner than peanut butter. It should'nt sag when applied to the wall. Fill the area and put some mesh tape over the edges. The joint compound that you purchase should be a 90 minute setting type. This means it will be dry within that time and you can reapply some more to finish it. I would also suggest using a regular joint compound to "feather out" and finish the area. It's easier to sand. This job is a little tricky. It takes alot of practice to get familiar with the tools and to get a good feel for the material. If you apply the joint compound evenly and smooth at each coat, you should have minimal sanding only after the last coat is applied.   Good luck  (If you have to remove to much plaster I would suggest screwing on a piece of 1/4 inch drywll in the area.)<SEP>How do I repair a lathe and plaster wall?

No offense to the previous answers but "Don't try to re-invent THE WHEEL"   Follow prescribed instructions.   Alternating tightening of the two bolts is a good idea.   Make certain the tank was seated properly to begin with, and the nuts threaded without cross threading. The metal washers are designed to prevent damage to the rubber washers under,,,or above them. The washers,,, or at least one of them should act as a flange type thing that seats in the bolt hole and expands to fill the hole as the nut is tightened.    Having them tightened but out of balance with each other will often cause an improper seating of one or both sides.   Drain and remove the tank. Check the condition of the hardware, perhaps buying new. Check the condition of the exit hole and the seal for it. Re- seat the tank, add the bolt with the metal washer added first, then the sealing washer. Under the tank add the rubber washer, metal washer, and nut. Tighten to what seems to be a point of some resisitence, perhaps as you can see the bottom rubber washer begin to expand a bit in its compression. Refill the tank just enough to check for leaks, and if you notice any, then tighten a half or quarter turn equally on each nut until the leaking stops.   Unless the tank or its main sealing holes have been corrupted, the leaking should vanish.Rev. Steven<SEP>How do I prevent leakage around the bolts holding the toliet tank to the toliet bowl? I purchased a kit which contained new bolts, 4 flat washers, 4 rubber washers and 4 nuts.  From top to bottom, I placed the washers as follows:  bolt, metal washer, rubber washer, through tank, metal washer, nut, through base, rubber washer, metal washer and then nut.  I tightened the first nut to a point that I was afraid to tighten it any more in fear I would crack the tank.  I tightened the second nut until the tank fully contacted the base and would not wobble.<EOS>

Back it off a half turn.Do this for the other screw. Then go back to the first and using quarter turns, turn clockwise and then back off when the engine runs rough. Do this for the other screw.Should be set fine now.You could also turn both screws all the way in, and then back off one and one half turns. Then start the engine and try quarter turns as explained above.Count the number of turns it took for each screw to tighten. Don't tighten too much. If worse comes to worse and the engine is running like a dog, put them back to where you started. And try again.<SEP>How do you adjust the carburetor on a 82 ford 4wd pu 460 motor  with a holly carb?<EOS>

HONEST ANSWERS.......Here goes.......Do you both rent? That would make things real simple. Being a Landlord myself, I know of what you speak.That's how they happen, a bathroom leak usually comes down in the downstairs living room, sometimes their small because if the drywall is solid or even new, water will actually sit in a puddle, depending on the size of the leak. First of all, go down there and tell him to show you the damage, usually the ceiling below the leak will be stained, kinda brown, from the drywall being wet. Before you do that,flush your toilet,make sure everything is quiet, listen for running water or drips. That kind of damage can be real bad,if there is water, it will soak the drywall, eventually it could all come down. Like I said in the beginning, if you both rent, it's the landlords problem, if he owns the house, make sure you see it, if you can't do it, get someone YOU KNOW to take care of it.......Hit Answers up again, I'll be looking for you.

just open the window, take out the screen, put the A/C on the sill at an angle, so that the outside portion is lower (this is to allow condensed water to drip out) then shut the top portion of the window tightly, you can use wood blocks to keep it tightly clamped on the unit.there are usually acordian fins on the sides of the A/C, pull them out to block the excess area of the window.you might want to stuff the remainging gaps with wash cloths, or tape them up, to keep bugs out.<SEP>How do i install a window unit air conditioner?<EOS>

First unscrew the armrest, and anything else on the door panel that maybe screwed in. Becareful, if you unscrew the lower guide light, the whole light assembly will come out, just unplug it, you'll  be ok. Then Along the edges of the panel you'll find these plastic clips retaining the panel onto the door frame...you  will literallly have to pull ( preferably a scraper may work, they do make tools for this, they look like big forks)on the panel to "un clip" from the door... Don't worry if you break a clip or three, you can find them on the Help Product isle at Pep Boys. Now when you have unclipped the panel pull up to get the window guides off the door edge, pull away slowly. You will have the window switch you need to unplug so pull panel away slowly and look behind panel to see if there are any connections you need to unplug. Ok now the door should be eposed! Just peel back the plastic cover carefully (if careful enough it will be able to re-adhere to door) Sometimes some window motors are rivted in, you will have to drill them out! They do sell rivet gun kits to replace the rivets. Now once the rivets are removed the motor should come free, becareful there are lots of sharp edges.... I'm pretty sure you can handle it from here! Just becarful when you place the motor in that it is lined up well and the track is straight...ok good luck!<SEP>How to remove car door panel from '82 Buick Park Avenue?
