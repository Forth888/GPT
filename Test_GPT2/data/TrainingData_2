First check the pad to make sure that there are no visilbe leaks.If no visible leaks then fill the pool up to the maximum level. Then do what's called a static water check. Turn all the equipment off and wait a few days until the water seeks the level of the leak, in which case it will stop lowering. Then take a very close look around the perimeter of the pool water and look for the leak. If it is in the liner, then patch it. If it stops at a suction or return line take a close look for any crack or break, if so then use something like an A and B expoxy to repair it. You can get it at your friendly neighborhood pool store. If you think the leak could be in the pool plumbing (between the pool and the equipment) you need to purchase some expandable test plugs (you can get them at Home Depot and other fine hardware stores) and plug all the suction and return lines (including the main drain if you have one). Big bummer if you have to swim to the bottom in cold water. You may have to use a screwdriver to remove a plastic cover to expose the piping to get to certain areas. Make sure you measure the pipe before going to the store to purchase the plugs. Most piping is 1 12" pvc or 2" pvc. Once the plugs are installed, fill the pool again and wait a couple days. If the level stays the same, the leak is not in the pool liner, it is somewhere in the plumbing.  If the piping is underground then big bummer dude. If that's the case I would next talk to your freindly neighborhood pool repair person for the next step, which could be pressure testing, etc. It all depends on how easy or difficult it is to access your plumbing. Good luck. <SEP> how do you locate a hole in an above ground pool liner? <EOS>

The torque-converter is bolted to the fly-wheel on the back of the engine and is slid in to the front pump on the transmission.  You will have to either remove the engine to get to it, or remove the transmission.  Removing the trans. is the prefered method by most.  There are 6 bell-housing bolts that must be removed that hold the engine and trans. togeteher.  There are 3 bolts that hold the torque-converter to the fly-wheel, remove them also, you will have to turn the crankshaft to allow access.  It is easiest to remove the starter to get it out of the way, along with the exhaust by unbolting it at the flange at the end of the manifold.  Then you have 2 cooling lines that screw into the trans., a driveshaft that you unbolt from the rear-differential, a dip-stick tube and the shifter linkage that unbolts from the trans. and the mount which is located at the bottom of the trans.  There is a crossmember that you have to unbolt from the frame, that is what the other end of the mount bolts to.  If you have four wheel drive you have to remove the front driveshaft and the linkage to it.  Some people also like to separate the transfer-case and the trans before removal.  There is also a speedometer cable and a few wires.  Word of advice, drain the transmission before you start.  After that the torque-convert will slide out of the front of the trans..  It looks like a big donut.  The new one will slide back on, but make sure to turn it to get it to go all the way in, there should not be enough room to get a finger between it and the transmission, and it should turn freely.  Reverse the removal and fill with fluid. <SEP> How do you remove a torque converter from transmission on a 1982 Chevrolet 3500 truck.? <EOS>

hi, you're going to need the manual for the garage door opener and possibly one for the wireless remote. If the opener is also a Crafsman, then you should find all the instructions you need in 1 manual.

If the website doesn't have the manual listed, you may need to call them to see how to get an out-of-print manual.

Check for three things.  The first is if the 'rooter" is removing gunk from the pipe. Pull it back occasionaly and check the tip and see if it has reached the clog.  If its fairly clean run the rooter farther down the pipe.  You may feel the rooter bit or grab into a larger or harder clog in a pipe.  If you do make sure you keep advanceing the rooter past the clog untill you feel the rooter loose the resistance as it exits the clog.  You may have to pull it back and advance it several times though the clogged area to completly remove all of the build up.  The last and most imporant thing to check is how well the water flows though the drain when your done.  If it still is slow or not flowing well, try again.  You might not have gotten all of the clog or there may be more build up down the pipe.  I like to snake the drain as far as the rooter will allow, even if I find a clog a short way down the pipe.  That way I know I've cleaned the pipe as well as I could and hopefully don't have to drag the rooter out again for a long time!!  After you get the pipe clear, try using a bacterial pipe cleaner every week or so.  It is harmless to you and the pipes ut will keep them very clean.  You can find the product at any hardware store or even WalMart.  It works well even on partially clogged drains and usually opens them up in 3 - 5 days. And you don't have to deal with the mess and hard work of using the rooter!! Good Luck <SEP> how do i know if the roto rooter im using is working? <EOS>

Unless you figure out a way to disable the light, the only way to get it to go away is to have the car hooked up to what is called an OBD II.  All mechanics shops have them.

There are numerous sensors attached to the engine, and if any one of them gives readings that are outside the suggested parameters, the light will come on.

I assume you have an electric water heater. If so I suspect one of the elements is burned out or one of the thermostats is bad. Electric water heaters have two thermostats and two heating elements.

The only way to address stale air in a building is an air change. You need a filtered supply of outside air. You'll be surprised how well a 12 inch filtered air duct from the outside will help.

If it is your own video, you can download the subtitles from the video manager. Go to:  Video Manager >> Edit (on the video you want) >> Captions >> (Click on the track you want to download) >> Actions (drop down box)  At the time of writing, there are three file types available:   .vtt  .srt  .sbv   These have different uses in different applications, but are very similar. SRT is probably the most common.  Otherwise, if it is not your video, the best method (only method) is to get the xml file from the Developer tools.  Using Google Chrome in this example, navigate to the video then follow these steps:   Pause the video. Wait for it to play if there is an advertisement.  Push F12 on your keyboard. This opens the developer tools. You may have to click on some empty space in the page so that the video is not active.  Click on the Network tab in the Developer Tools.  Click the transcript icon just below the video. Two items will come up in the Network tab in the Developer Tools.  Both items are titled timedtext? plus a bunch of variables. The second one is typically the one you want. It starts like this:  <transcript>      <text start="4.14" dur="3.049">my name is doctor john rush</text>      <text start="7.189" dur="3.731">I'm the CEO and president</text>   This xml file is useful if you want to use the transcript in a web page. Other than that, I don't think you can use it the same way you would use an SRT file. If you are any good at programming, you can easily write up a program that will convert it to SRT.

"The air conditioning system in your car is comprised of a compressor, condenser, expansion valve and evaporator. If you have ever used a can of compressed air to clean computer components, you will know that the bottle gets very cold in a short amount of time. This is due to the rapid expansion of the compressed gas. The same thing happens in your car’s air conditioning system. Refrigerant (AKA Freon) is compressed in the compressor and turns into a hot gas. In the condenser, this hot gas is cooled to a liquid state and travels to the expansion valve. As the Freon goes through the expansion valve it returns to a low-pressure gas and rapidly cools in the evaporator. A fan blows over the evaporator and cools the air that eventually blows out your vents." <SEP> How does a car AC compressor work?If any one know some webs and pictures about it please send me.? <EOS>
Do you have the thermostat in your part of the building? Introduce it to some cold. Put a fan on it or even ice cubes.Many people accidentally do the opposite of this, even me! Cold house with the thermostat turned up? I had moved a lamp directly underneath the thermostat.

With computer boards inside modern furnaces, a crossed wire can mean a $300 repair. Don't touch unless you're an electronics tech that can read a circuit diagram and figure out what would need to be done safely.A plug-in space heater would be your next best bet.

The simple ingredients of baking soda and vinegar can unclog drains. Best of all, you're fixing the problem without pouring anything toxic down the drain.   Steps:  1.   Remove contents from sink/tub.  2.   Pour 1/4 cup of baking soda down the drain.  3.   Pour in one cup of vinegar into the drain.  4.   Cover the drain with a lid and wait fifteen minutes. The baking soda and vinegar will have a chemical reaction, breaking down the clog.  5.   Rinse the drain with hot water to clear it out.  6.   Repeat if necessary.        Tips:   You may need to use a plunger to help break the clog. I have also heard about adding table salt to the concoction.

So much for all these so called "trained technicians"......The motor will run if 180 out but not well.  I have done this simply to proove a  point and get a few bucks.  It will NOT dammage the engine.  Many of the people on here do not have a clue and answer out of ignorance.  You need to check anything you have removed or replaced (cam, distributor, etc.)  If everything checks out well then the problem is most likely in the ignition. While you are in it I would recomend changing the points over to electronic.  You can get a kit from Pertronix to do this that is much more reliable and doesn't change the under hood appearance of the motor.

See if you can Remove the P-trap and clear it that way. IF, it is not the P-trap clogged and further down the drain, you may have to use a small Rotor-Rooter it a flexible spring thing.

You need to list what part of the emission test is not passing. Is it excessive CO? Excessive NOx? Or excessive Hydrocarbons? Each has a different reason for causing the failure.Excessive CO means you're lacking oxygen for complete combustion. Check the air cleaner and air intake.Excessive Hydrocarbons means too much fuel or poor combustion. Check Fuel injectors to be sure they aren't sticking, Spark plugs.Excessive NOx means combustion is too hot. You've got various ways to reduce NOx emissions. Typically a variable valve systems will automatically minimize NOx emissions which I believe the CRX has. However if there is a PCV valve, EGR Valve I'd check theses first. <SEP> How do I get my car to pass emissions? My Honda CRX will not pass the Washington emission test, and I have brought it through about three times.

My daughter put corn "silk" in the disposer, and it got really clogged up once! First you must turn off the electricity to the disposer, so you don't grind up your fingers or hand! The take the cover off the top and see what is in there and how full it is.  You can reach (it's yucky!) down in there and pull things out as much as possible. Try to get something (a large wooden spoon works great!) to put in and try to turn the blades (both ways) until you get them loose. Keep reaching in as you get it free to take out whatever is stopping the blades from turning. Keep working with the blades and taking stuff out (I have had to work at it for over 30 minutes for the worst one!) until you can turn the blades. Then reconnect the power and try to see if it will turn by itself.To prevent this from happening again, put a small amount of ice down the drain every once in a while or grind up lemon or thin orange peels to help clean the blades out (The lemons and oranges will make it smell better too!) Set a restriction of things that cannot go into the disposer, and post it next to the sink on a cabinet door. The next one who clogs it has to pay for the plummer, or do this diry job themselves!

You're talking about a sewing machine, or something used in farming? The best advice is to read the instruction manual, if the machine itself doesn't have some sort of guide marked on it.With your thread spindle on the right, there is most likely a little something on the left to pull the thread around, then down and beneath something of a U shape, on the right side. Bring the thread up on the left and hook it in the metal piece there. Then down and hook in the little catch above the needle. Thread the needle and pull the thread under the presser foot.

The best time to check the engine oil of any vehicle? I usually check in the morning before I start the engine. The vehicle must be park and level straight. Modern cars and vehicles have this universal color, I think it is color Orange. The Owners Manual of that car or vehicle has the location of the (orange) dipstick for the oil. The (orange) dipstick shows the level of the oil. It has the marking below the end of the dipstick either a line, a dotted circle, a punched out small circle, a xxxx that resembles the wooden file. If that falls between the marking (it has to be below the top marking), then the oil is on the right level.If you must checked the engine oil, turn off the engine and wait for 10 minutes. Get a tissue and pull the dipstick out and wipe it. Push the dipstick back all the way, then pull it out and see if the oil is between the markings below the dipstick.If you parked uphill, the oil level shows it's almost empty.If you parked downhill, the oil level shows it's almost full. <SEP> How to check the engine oil of my car?

Working on AC & Heat is like wiring a house, you have to complete the circuit. With AC work you basicly have three circuits low voltag (24vac) High (120/240vac or better) and then freon.

Solar water heaters perform three basic operations before the hot water comes out of your tap:1. Energy Collection: Sunlight is collected and converted to heat energy.The solar collector is mounted on or near your home facing south. As the sunlight passes through the collector’s glazing, it strikes an absorbing material. This material converts the sunlight into heat, and the glazing prevents the heat from escaping in a similar manner to leaving a car parked in the sun with its windows rolled up. The temperature inside a glazed solar collector on your roof can easily reach 150°C when there is no heat transfer fluid flowing through it.The two most common types of solar collectors used in solar water heaters are glazed flat plate and evacuated tube collectors. A glazed flat plate collector consists of a shallow rectangular box with a transparent glass “window” covering a flat black plate. The black plate is attached to a series of parallel tubes or one serpentine tube through which air, water, or other heat transfer fluids pass.An evacuated tube collector consists of several individual glass tubes, each containing a black metal pipe through which the heat transfer fluid passes. The space between the pipe and the glass tube is “evacuated,” so the air is removed.Although uncommon, unglazed plastic collectors can be used as a seasonal solar water heating system. However, they are used mostly for pool heating. Each collector has its advantages, and each can perform well if matched with the proper, well-designed, storage unit.2. Energy Transfer: Circulating fluids transfer the collected energy in the form of heat to a storage tank.Heat energy is transferred from the collector to the water storage tank. In some water heaters, hot fluid is pumped from the collector to the storage tank. The pump is powered by electricity that either comes from an electrical wall outlet or a small photovoltaic module located beside the collector.In other types of solar water heaters, the sun heats the storage tank directly, so the fluid in the collector is heated and rises naturally to a storage tank above the collector. This type of solar water heater is often referred to as a thermosiphon system. It does not  require an electric pump. Passive solar and solar photovoltaic-powered systems will continue to operate even if there is a power outage. The products that require electricity from a wall outlet will not operate during a power outage.3. Energy StorageSolar-heated water is stored in an insulated tank until you need it. Hot water is drawn off the tank when tap water is used, and cold make-up water enters at the bottom of the tank.Solar water heaters tend to have a slightly larger hot water storage capacity than  conventional water heaters. This is because solar heat is available only during the day and sufficient hot water must be collected to meet evening and morning requirements. <SEP> how does solar water heaters work? <EOS>

You would picture a clock with its face toward the floor. Then if you have the fan running in its slowest mode, you can watch the fan blades and see if they turn clockwise (the same direction the hands of a clock turn) or counterclockwise (the opposite direction the hands of a clock turn).It would have to be considered 'face-down' because the best way to tell if something is turning in a certain direction is to look at it head-on.

To get a good match to the existing concrete, use a topping or sand mix of pre-mixed concrete.

Also be sure to cover the patch (with a piece of plastic) and keep it moist, ideally for 3 days.The vinyl patching mixes (by Quickcrete or Thorocrete) are a bit darker than "standard" concrete.

First thing you should do is setup your filter.. make sure it's running correctly.Next, vacuum the bottom of your pool and skim the debris off the top.Add lots of chlorine. I get a 5 gallon barrel from my local supplier. Add a bottle of Algaecide concentrate (R60). Run your filter continuously for several days. Your sand filter will require frequent backwashing. The frequency of how often you backwash depends on the filter pressure. The pressure gage on your sand filter will increase as it removes particulate from the water.  On mine, when it reaches around 17-20, I know that it needs a good backwashing. <SEP> how do you open your swimming pool?  My water is really dirty I cannot see the bottom?

Carefully insert the special hook tools, for mercedes dash, on the left and right side of the dash cluster about 3/4 way up from the bottom inbetween the cluster and the dashboard and latch them onto the back of the cluster.  This usually takes a little bit of feel and manuvering.  Be careful not to hurt the dashboard.  Once the tools are firmly hooked on the back of the cluster, pull the cluster to you firmly but politely.  Do not let the tools slip off the back of the cluster as they may cause damage.  The cluster is held in by tension clips.  You may want to rock the cluster left to right as you tug on it using moderate force.  Again, it takes a certin amount of feel, be carefule not to damage the dash cluster or dash  board.  Once the dash board is releised, you may reach behind it and undue the bulb holders in the back of the dash.  You may want to twist the dash bit to gain access but be carefull of the wiring connected to it.  the bulb holder will undue by twisting them top left about 1/4 way in a circle.  When setting the cluster back into the tension clips, position the dash and press firmly on the clusters edges to re-seat it. A little silicone lube on the clips mat aid this prosses.  Be sure not to press on the cluster to hard as damage to the plastic covering may result.  This prossess is not dificult but it does take finece.

On the vast majority of engines, if the timing belt snaps, say goodbye too your valves, piston, or engine in general.Some cars (very few) have a "FREE RUN" engine. These are so low performance that when the belt breaks, the engine will just stop, because of the valves no longer functioning.HOWEVER, most engines' valves operate close enough to the pistons, with the TIMING of both the only thing keeping them from running into each other.When the belt breaks, the cam stops turning, so the valves stay in whatever position the happen to be in at the time.Because of the crankshaft still trying to turn (think inertia, centrifugal force, etc.) the pistons are still going to move a bit, until the energy in the crankshaft is used up, OR THEY HIT SOMETHING, LIKE AN OPENED VALVE!You WILL either:a)bend a valveb)crack a piston headc)crack a piston (with the broken off pieces scarring up the cylinder wall, remember, the piston will continue to travel a little bit)d)crack a cylinder wall, possibly through the water jackete)all of the above-or-f)none of the above, because ya might get lucky, as even a blind squirrel finds a nut now and then! <SEP> How does Timing Belt affect the Engine? I have a 97 Volvo 850 gasoline car.

I was told that it's very important to have the timing belt replaced before it breaks but the belt is working alright so far.  They said if it breaks, it's going to damage the engine and it will be very very costly...  Any opinion and suggestion out there?  I appreciate if someone can give me a second opinion.

The generator has an external voltage regulator that must be checked for proper wiring and operation before condeming the generator.  The wiring to the generator must be checked as well.  The brushes on the generator can be replaced while the generator is still on the vehicle.  This is usually all that goes wrong with a generator.  Replacing the generator is somewhat complicated when the engine is still in the vehicle. I'll give it a shot but its been quite a while since I've done one.   The generator turns a blower that cools the engine located the big semicircular housing on top of the engine.  There is an oil cooler that sticks up inside this housing that has to be removed to get the housing off.  It is secured with 4 bolts if memory serves.  Remove the two 10 mm bolts on either side of the blower housing. You have to remove the generator pulley nut to take apart the pulley to remove the belt. Remember which shims went where.  Shims are used to tighten the belt. Remove the generator clamp and remove the generator stand or bracket.  After that stuff is out of the way you should be able to lift the blower housing to access the oil cooler bolts.  You will also have to remove the carburetor.  (Just 2 bolts, some hoses and a cable clamp).  When and if you get the housing out there is a large 36mm nut holding the blower fan to the generator that will have to be removed to transfer the fan to the new generator.  This job is a lot easier if the engine is removed from the vehicle.  Reverse the instructions above to reassemble.  I always wanted to say that!!  Other techs will understand. <SEP> how to install a generator on a 69 vw beetle baha? the battary keeps going dead and the red light in the speedometer is always on.

Usually you smell gas first, if only faintly as apparently you have. Some of the gas line connections or the line itself eventually rust through and the gas just wets the outside of the line right around where the rust spots are. So follow the lines as suggested above, and look for wet spots. The fuel vapor recovery system in your car might also be responsible for a gas smell if it's not working properly. Fuel tanks rust through eventually and start leaching gas also. Gas leaks are dangerous as you know, so get it fixed ASAP. <SEP> How would I find a fuel leak in my car? <EOS>
Opened. Radiaters work by moving hot water through the tubes of the radiater which give off the heat into the room.

To properly bleed a boiler takes time and Patience. Your boiler should have an auto fill valve to let water in. Hopefully you also have boiler drains on each zone. These drains will have a connection to hook up a garden hose. Direct the garden hose to a drain in the floor, or somewhere that will get rid of the water. Caution, this water is not only hot(180-200 Degrees) but can be very black as well, so choose carefully were you drain to.Turn one of your t-stats up so the zone you are working on comes on, you can feel the hot water by placing your hand on the pipe, again be care full, it is very hot. if the zone is open but not flowing, slowly opening the drain should push the air lock through. do not open or drain the zone to quick, you do not want to let the boiler go dry, bad things happen then. When you feel the hot water come back to the boiler through the pipe you know you have flow. You can hear the air in the pipes as it circulates and open the drain slowly to purge the air out. You need to do this to each and every zone in the system.It is advisable to have an experienced HVAC tech. do this if you are not comfortable, and watch him, ask questions. This is your system, you should know how and why it works. Good luck. <SEP> how do you bleed the boiler? <EOS>

You need to determine if the drywall has been cracked or compromised in any way.  If it has it might not be a simple matter of spackling. You may need to cut a hole square and then shave about a third of the drywall off around it.  Then get a piece of screen, like from an old screen door, cut it to fit the shaved area, and then spackle it in.  Be sure to apply a little spackling before you put the screen in so it has something to stick to from the back as well as the front.  Then wait until the spackling dries and add another layer. Lat that dry as well.  Keep adding successive layers and letting them dry until the spackling is roughly flush with the surrounding surface area.  Then you need to take some 200 grit sandpaper and sand the dried spackling until it's as smooth as it can be and there is very little if any differentiation between the spackled area and the surrounding area.   If you don't think your drywall has been cracked or compromised just forego cutting a hole and add successive layers of spackling.  Let it dry and then paint over it. <SEP> How do you Spackle a wall that has pieces of dry wall missing from slight water damage? -water leak is fixed-want to paint but need to fix the wall first-there is not a hole just some of the outside surface is worn away on the wallplease help <EOS>
Well since you live in a Apartment building The only thing you can really do is Pull back the carpet And Mark the floor joist with a chalk lineThen use 2 1/2 deck locking screws every 6 inches or so This will pull the flooring down to the studs. also If any nails are sticking up hammer them in. This is the best way to fix this problem since you in a apartment. If you lived in a house and had a basement you could fix it from the bottom. since this is not the case this is all you can do. Call a carpet guy out to pull back the carpet off the tack strip (or do that yourself) do this to the floor and Call the Carpet guy back to kick the carpet back into place. Try to do this when the person you live above or below is not home it will make some noise. The carpet guy wont cost much.Also where you hear the noise start there with the screws after you put in 30 or so walk the floor untill the noise is gone. after the noise is gone put a screw in every 12 to 16 inches past the part where the noise stopped. this will make sure the noise did not travel and will slao stop it from moving down the hall or somewhere else..Happy screwing..LOLI had to write back to this ? and the 1 answer You dont want to cut the carpet If you do this the landlord can make you pay for new carpet. @nd make sure you find the joist if you do not find them and you drive a 3 inch screw into the floor and no joist you could hit a water line or elec. <SEP> How can  I stop the wood in my floor, under my carpet, from squeaking?

You will need to remove either the throttle body or carb depending on what year the van is. The chain must be slung over the engine very close to the opening in the intake manifold, actually as tight as you can get it. When lifting you may need to use a pry bar to get the mounts clear of the frame brackets or unbolt them from the engine. I have done engine swaps several times on my Chevy work vans, the last being a 1992 model with the old body style. I assume you have taken the front of the van apart already?

If there is oil on the shocks or dirt sticking to oil on the shocks that means they are losing oil, which means the seals are starting to get worn. There is no way to replace the oil in them so u just have to replace the shock. AFter you hit a bump does you truck bounce once or twice then stop and smooth out or does it keep bouncing and eventually stop? your suspension should only cycle once or twice after you go over a dip or bump then the shock should be able to stop it and smooth it out.

Interesting.  I tested by sending an email to my Gmail acct from an Exchange account, and setting the flag urgent.  Then I looked at the email in the web interface and from Outlook. In Outlook (getting Gmail) I saw the message flagged urgent. In the Web interface, I saw no urgent indication.  I replied to the message from the web interface and from Outlook. In the web interface, the urgent flag was not shown, and did not make it back to the Exchange account. In Outlook, the reply did not have the urgent flag activated, but when I activated it it was visible back on the Exchange account.  So, to summarize .. the Gmail web interface does not recognize the urgent flag, at least not as implemented by Microsoft Exchange. But the Gmail engine does not lose the header data when it is provided by another client.  As an aside .. I find the urgent flag far more irritation than it is worth.  Rarely does "urgent" to you mean that it should be "urgent" to me. When is the last time that you received a message flagged "low priority"?  IMHO it is far better to indicate in the subject and body that the issue is urgent or time-sensitive.

I have to assume you're talking about the thermostat that controls the oven heat.   Not knowing how old your unit is,  on most ranges the oven control knob will pull straight off the shaft and reveal the valve behind.   The opening of the range body will be just slightly larger than the valve shaft, so you will need a fairly small screwdriver, usually flat bladed, to possibly loosen a small screw and move a small lever or slide control on the side of the valve.  Don't move it much at a time, just a few degrees, then try the oven to see where the setting is .  You'll need a good oven thermometer to check. <SEP> how do i adjust the thermostat on an old gas range? <EOS>
I will tell youTools Required:drill/driver, Phillips screw tip, level, pencil, and stepladder. And to make the job easier, use a screw holder extension in the screw gun, and a magnetic level.How to install / hang a curtain rod:(1) Tape 8 ½” x 11” pieces of paper on the wall where the curtain rod mounts will go to prevent unnecessary marks on the wall. It is usually best to put the mounts close to the ends of the Drapery rod, so that you have as much space as possible between the mounts to stack your draperies. If your drapery rod is 120” long, you might center your mounts at 119” to utilize the entire length of the drapery rod. (2) Hold one curtain rod mount up and make sure it is high enough so that the curtains will cover the top of the window. Higher than the top of the window by a few inches may look better, and block out more light. Using a pencil, mark the location of the bottom screw hole on the paper and set the curtain rod mount down while you pre-drill a hole into the wall just deep enough to make it easy to drive the screw nice and straight. (3) Holding the curtain rod mount in one hand, and the screw gun in the other, drive the bottom screw into the wall. Level the curtain rod mount, and drive in the top screw. (4) Put the finials on the curtain rod, go to the other end of the curtain rod, lay the (magnetic) level on top of the curtain rod, hold the curtain rod and the curtain rod mount together and raise them up so the curtain rod is level, and the other end is sitting in the curtain rod mount that you have previously installed. (5) Repeat step 3 (6) Remove one finial, slide the rings onto the curtain rod, drop the curtain rod into place, and slide the curtain pins with curtains attached into the ring eyelets. (7) Remove one finial, slide the rings onto the drapery rod, drop the drapery rod into place, and slide the drapery pins with draperies attached into the ring eyelets. (8) Stand back, pat yourself on the back, and admire the quality and beauty of your new curtain rods made especially for you by Paso Robles Ironworks. How to install an extra long curtain rod:If you are installing an extra long curtain rod with a center connector and center mount, mark the center of the window, and install exactly as above, one side at a time. This means, temporarily install both finials on one of the curtain rod sections, and mount that first half as if it were a separate curtain rod. Then using the same half section with finials installed, proceed to step 4 and install the third mount. Now you are ready to put the entire curtain rod together and with a helper, and proceed to step 6. <SEP> how would i hang a curtain rod?

Regarding the TOILET BOWL STANDING WATER AFTER A FLUSH HAS OCCURED:You might want to check to see if your overflow pipe has water running into it. Fluidmaster appropriately calls this the "refill tube."  This usually is the little hose that runs from the filler valve. Regarding the TOILET TANK WATER BEFORE A FLUSH HAS OCCURED:The float cup (or float ball) stops too low in the tank. This usually can be adjusted by adjusting the screws at the top where the arm meets the valve or for Fluidmaster units, the spring can be adjusted so that there is less room between the top of the valve and the metal spring.Check out the links below to get more information! <SEP> how to make my tolet fill up with more water? my tolet fills up i just got done fixing the rubber wahers on the tank and the bolts how can i make the water fill up more it fills up fine i just want the water a little higher? thanks <EOS>

Turn off the electric @ the Breaker box. Pull the Switch out. Unscrew one wire and move it to the other wire and connect the two together. What you doing is Bypassing the Switch. Then turn on the electric and see if the Problem is gone. If it the Switch. Turn off the Breaker again and Remove and Replace. I just tell everyone to stay away and leave things hanging until I finish, so I not doing and undoing 3-4 times. IF, the switch is good and the problem there after you bypass it...... I not sure what it doing, but, sounds like a Light or Ceiling fan. Turn off the Breaker and Remove the Light/Fan and check for a loose wire, Sometimes they use those Screw on Caps to hold the wires and one may be loose and just need tightened.You can post in you Comments, if, this works, if not, give an idea of what happening and I add the next step. <SEP> how do i tell if a light switch is going bad or if i have a serious electrical problem instead? <EOS>

Despite requests for this feature since 2009, the Gmail team refused to implement it.  There are however browser extensions and apps that let you schedule new emails or replies:   Streak is a free browser extension CRM for Gmail and has a "Send later" feature (you don't need to bother with the CRM at all). You can conveniently schedule a reply right from the Compose box. I've been using it for about a year and it works very well, except that if I change the Subject line, the message won't go through. You need to go in Drafts and Send it Later from there again, under the new Subject line. Works for Google Apps accounts, as well as Gmail. Best choice.  RightInbox is free for up to 10 emails per month, and supports email tracking via an embedded image (web bug). I've used it in its early stage while it was very buggy and corresponded with its author. You can schedule replies right from the Compose window.  Boomergang is free for up to 10 emails per month. After that, it's $5/mo for Gmail accounts and $15 for Google Apps accounts.  Gmail Delay Send is a script you have to install via Google Docs. I tried it; the process was somewhat convoluted and the tool is rough and immature. It is however fully free and open source, and won't add any additional load to your browser (unlike extensions). This is the most promising and most lightweight solution . Unfortunately, it has seen no development since May 2012 .  Momento Mail is a Google App (not a browser extension), and you have to use their own website. As of November 2013, it no longer works (directs to a blank page after typing in the scheduling and recipient info). To schedule a reply, you'd have to copy/paste the To, CC and email body from Gmail. Quite cumbersome. Their "To" field doesn't support the standard address format Name <address@company.com> . The message won't end up in your Gmail Sent folder, but you have an option to BCC yourself. Least recommended. <SEP> Can I set an e-mail to send on a timer within Gmail? <EOS>
You need to what we call backflush or reverse the flow of the coolant in the system. as the engine gets hotter ther thermostat located usually near the top of the engine will open and allow coolant to flow to the radiator where it then falls through the channels and the mving air passing through the radiator cools it, so your coolant flows in this direction to remove impurities you have to reverse the flow.  Remove the thermostat and then force water the opposite way round the system including the radiator, you can add a flushing compound but the most important thing is to continue witth this until you get clear water, when finished refit the thermostat and new gasket/seal if it has one and then add the correct amount of antifreeze and top off with water til it reaches the level required, run vehicle with the heater on hot until normal operating temp is reached and then very very carefully using a rag gently remove the pressure cap to check the level, if it is low use warm water to top it up as this will avoid a coolant shock to any of the alloy components and gaskets in the engine.

When inspecting the belt, if it appears to be glazed (shiny), show cuts, cracks or other deterioration on either side or on the edges, has chunks missing from it, or is merely noisy—it has to be changed. It's helpful if you can determine the cause of a particular problem—from normal wear to damage—so you can be assured that the replacement belt will last the full duration of its service life.   Before taking off the belt, check your service manual for any helpful tips that apply to your specific vehicle. One caution: as belt tensioners are sprung very tightly (some tighter than others), any "slips" involving the wrench used to loosen belt tension can cause serious personal injury, as well as damage to the surrounding area under the hood. Ideally you should use the special service tool designed for belt-tension removal (via the tensioner). Be aware of where the tool will be positioned when tension is removed and make sure the tensioner is resting on its internal "stop." Obviously, if the tool contacts another component before the tensioner stop is contacted, tension is not completely released and the tool will "jam" if left to rest in that position. The possibility of the tool slipping off of the tensioner is high, and injury will likely result. Once tension is properly released, it's time to remove the belt. Start removal from the most easily accessed and largest pulley having the least amount of belt contact, if possible (sometimes this is the tensioner, sometimes not). Usually, it's just a matter of pulling the belt clear of the other pulleys and right out of the engine bay. However, sometimes engine mounts or other components such as splash shields first need to be removed. Once the belt is out, here are a few other components to inspect: > Coolant pump for leakage (will cause belt noise if coolant gets on belt) or bad bearing > Fan Clutch (if equipped) for fluid leakage > Fan for damage (especially a problem with plastic fans) > Tensioner unit for noisy pulley bearing or wear on tensioner mechanism > Idler pulley(s) for noisy bearing or irregularly worn belt contact area (especially a problem on plastic pulleys) > Any under hood component that is making contact with or is close to the belt, tensioner, or any pulleys > Any other source of fluid leakage onto the belt With all of that correct, the belt can now be installed. Since all replacement belts are not created equal, get the best quality belt possible. The same cautions highlighted earlier should be observed on reinstallation. Be patient. Route the belt in reverse order of removal, keeping especially vigilant about making sure that the belt ribs are set correctly in the pulley grooves, and the back of the belt is squarely contacting the tensioner and idler pulley(s), before starting the engine. If applicable, note the tensioner position "scale" (its arrow should be somewhere between the two lines on the other half of the tensioner, preferably on the "tight" side). If it's way off, the belt may be incorrect. phew...hope that helps. <SEP> how do I change the serpentine belt on my 01 dodge intrepid? <EOS>

The Car Power Steering System consists of the followings:1. Rack & Pinion Power Steering Gear2. Hydraulic Pump3. Oil Reservoir (you will find a small white plastic or metallic canister with a black cap on it & some traces of red color hydrulic oil, remember another Reservoir opposite to this Oil Reservoir with 'green' or 'blue' liquid traces is for radiator coolant)4. HosesThe Connection:There are three Pulleys:1. Main Crankshaft2. Hydraulic Pump (related to your question)3. Air ConditionerThe Belt connects these three items and in between them there is an IDLER pulley. This pulley is adjustable and is used for adjustment of the belt tension.So, the System works as follows, when you turn ON the ignition:1. The Hydraulic Pump starts pumping the oil to the Power Steering System (supplies pressurerized oil to one inlet, through one of the two main Hoses---called as 'Pressure Port').2. The 'Return Port' sends back  the 'used' oil back to the Oil Resevoir through the other remaining main hose---to make it available for the Hydraulic Pump to use when needed.So the cycle keeps on going until you switch OFF the engine.Changing the BELT (your question):1. Loosen the IDLER Pulley.2. Remove the Belt over the Crankshaft, Airconditioner and Hydraulic Pump pulleys.3. Replace new belt in the same way.4. Tighten the IDLER Pulley. When you tight it, ensure that the tension is about 2-3 mm (press & pull the belt until you get the 2-3 mm up & down belt movement feel---after you place it over all the three pulleys---at the same time tightening the IDLER pulley at the required torque (so that it doesn't gets loosen easily).Ready! <SEP> how can I change the power steering belt to a 1987 maxima? <EOS>

How exactly are you going to get the right amount of air flowing through the passenger cabin?  Are you driving a race car with forced air induction from somewhere?  If not then you are wasting your time.  A cold air intake requires you to mount it low OUTSIDE the passenger compartment.  The air wont be colder unless the inside of your car is below 0 and being forced to the motor with a supercharged fan.  Just remember the KISS principle.  Keep It Simple Stupid!  I'm not saying your stupid its just a term.  A 4x4 snorkel is not the same as a cold air intake.  The snorkel allows you to drive your truck through mud and water that is over the level of an unmodified truck.  My truck has a snorkel mounted on the roof and in theory I can drive it through water that deep without stalling.

A Google Docs document encodes everything in 'elements' within the Kix editor that it's all based on (it's closed source as basically this is the big trade secret, with which anyone else could run their own Docs service - which is a shame imo).  You can access these elements with Google Apps Script, a variant of Javascript - but writing Markdown from the elements isn't as straightforward as you'd think (you have to essentially implement a markdown parser in Apps Script).  When I came to do this earlier in the year there were dozens of forks of Renato Mangini's " gdocs2md " repo, but he seemed to have stopped fielding pull requests, and over the period of a few years forks had appeared that were far better than others. I went through many of these in the tree and put the best into a new package, which also generates HTML mixed with the markdown for elements Google Docs supports such as superscript and subscript elements (which markdown has no way of representing). Even incorporating the best of others' edits, the parsing needed work, and I'm confident that this is the best available for the job at present.  Script available on GitHub with installation instructions:  lmmx/gdocs2md-html  I also worked on adding in the most important feature to such a script - user features - providing the markdown in a pop-up within Google Docs rather than saving to file (I think the original was batch saving for entire folders, which is not suitable for my document-drafting needs, or how I use Google Docs at all).    I'd like to suggest it be a single more sophisticated project for interested developers to collaborate on (or at least suggest features for) rather than everyone forking off scripts of various quality, when we're likely working to the same aims.  As well as reducing duplication of effort, the Google Docs policy for creation of "add-ons" states that to be published (and therefore 'installable' rather than needing to be loaded for each document in a slightly awkward manner)    The add-on must be fully functional — it can't be a “work in progress.”  The script has been tested with multiple active users.    Obviously if you wanted a "pure" markdown then either switch off these features (the code is there to fork) or just don't use sub/superscripts, etc. It wouldn't be too difficult to add personalised settings to such a script if it matures as an add-on, if there's significant interest. <SEP> How can Google Docs and markdown play nice? <EOS>

GENERAL CLEAN-UP PROCEDURES Identify and correct the moisture source Clean, disinfect, and dry the moldy area Bag and dispose any material that has moldy residues, such as rags, paper, leaves, or debris. What can I save? What should I toss? Substances that are porous and can trap molds, such as paper, rags, wallboard, and rotten wood should be decontaminated and thrown out. Harder materials such as glass, plastic, or metal can be kept after they are cleaned and disinfected. Ultimately, it is critical to remove the source of moisture first, before beginning remedial action, since mold growth will return shortly if an effected area becomes re-wetted. Removal of Moldy Materials After fixing the moisture source and removing excess moisture, the cleanup can begin: Wear gloves when handling moldy materials Remove porous materials (examples: ceiling tiles, sheetrock, carpeting, wood products) Carpeting can be a difficult problem -- drying does not remove the dead spores. If there is heavy mold, disposal of the carpet should be considered Bag and discard the moldy substances Allow the area to dry 2 or 3 days If flooded, remove all sheetrock to at least 12 inches above the high water mark. Visually inspect the wall interior and remove any other intrusive molds. (This step may have to be carried out by a licensed contractor). CAUTION: Spores are easily released when moldy material is dried out. Soap Cleanup Before disinfecting contaminated areas, clean the areas to remove as much of the mold (and food it is growing on) as possible. Wear gloves when doing this cleanup Use a non-ammonia soap or detergent, or a commercial cleaner, in hot water, and scrub the entire area affected by the mold Use a stiff brush or cleaning pad on block walls or uneven surfaces Rinse clean with water. A wet/dry vacuum is handy for this. Disinfect Surfaces Wear gloves when using disinfectants After thorough cleaning and rinsing, disinfect the area with a solution of 10% household bleach (e.g., 1½ cup bleach per gallon of water). Using bleach straight from the bottle will not be more effective Never mix bleach with Ammonia - the fumes are toxic For spraying exterior large areas, a garden hose and nozzle can be used When disinfecting a large structure, make sure the entire surface is wetted (floors, joists, and posts) Avoid excessive amounts of runoff or standing bleach Let disinfecting areas dry naturally overnight -- this extended time is important to kill all the mold. CAUTION: Bleach fumes can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, and damage clothing and shoes. Make sure the working area is ventilated well. Can cleaning up mold be hazardous to my health? Yes. Exposure to mold can occur during the cleaning stage. Mold counts are typically 10 to 1000 times higher than background levels during the cleaning of mold damaged materials. Take steps to protect your health during cleanup: When handling or cleaning moldy materials, consider using a mask or respirator to protect you from breathing airborne spores. Respirators can be purchased from hardware stores; select one for particle removal (sometimes referred to as a N95 or TC-21C particulate respirator). Respirators are not as effective removing bleach fumes, so minimize your exposure when using bleach or other disinfectants. Wear protective clothing that is easily cleaned or discarded Use rubber gloves Try cleaning a small test patch of mold first. If you feel that this adversely affected your health, you should consider paying a licensed contractor or professional to carry out the work Ask family members or bystanders to leave areas when being cleaned. Work over short time spans and rest in a fresh air location. Air your house out well during after the work CAUTION: Never use a gasoline engine indoors (e.g. pressure washer, generator) -- you could expose yourself and your family to carbon monoxide.

I feel it has to do with who views your page, for how long, who you view, for how long,  and how frequently you search them. Your friends probably has a somewhat large value to show up first and/or their friends and the value can probably be lowered than a non-friend due to the time factor spent on a non-friend's page. Maybe even clicks is played into the search. There is a complicated formula. Facebook is crazy about this stuff. In the movie, when Mark (facebook CEO) did the site about which girl at school was hot or not, he ask a friend to come up with a formula to determine a winner. With how brilliant facebook has become, I don't doubt for a second that they take into consideration all these factors and 20,000 others when designing this formula.  I liked this guy and I couldn't find his page. Of course he was searching me as well and I'm assuming the reason why I was unable to search him was because he made his page only searchable to friends.

Serpentine belts are typically flat, multi-ribbed and about 1 1/4 inch wide and have a tensioner that automatically keeps the belt tight. They literally "snake" around many power accessory pulleys.So you must be talking about a "V belt", named for the V shape that rides in the pulleys it drives. V belts are tightened individually by loosening the bolts which hold the driven accessory alternator, pump, compressor or other in place. Don't remove the bolts completely if you attempt to tighten the belt, and sometimes you need somebody to use a lever bar or similar to rotate the accessory and tighten the belt while you retighten the bolts. Some people try "belt dressing" to stop a slipping V belt (not for use on serpentine belts), but the best thing is to tighten or replace the belt if it is 6 years old or more. An auto repair manual (like Haynes) from the auto parts store can show details of which bolts to loosen, or you can go to a library and use their auto repair manuals. <SEP> how to fix a lose fan belt? <EOS>

As long as the power consumption of the fixture is not too high, like upto 200 watts, you just need to change the plug, the light bulbs to 110V type, and no need to change the wiring.  Normally, a 200 watt fixture running at 220V draws exactly 200/220 or less than 1 ampere.  So, if you power your fixture to 200 watts at 110 volts, the current will be 200/110 which is less than 2 amperes.  Normally they use a #16 or #14 wires in the fixtures...so, I think that should be okay.

You can breathe a sigh of relief because your particular car's engine is NOT an interference engine, meaning the valves will NOT touch the pistons if it goes out of time. Anybody who posts, telling you otherwise, is full of S***. Even more good news is that it is also VERY easy to replace on your particular car if you are somewhat skilled. Any place you take it to, should not charge you any more than 3 hours of labour to do the repair. Any more than that, they are ripping you off. The belt itself, is also very inexpensive, even from the Ford dealer. Are you going to attempt to replace it yourself? If so, the sizes for the fasteners are 17mm for the engine mount fasteners, mostly 10mm for the splash guards underneath, as well as the fasteners that secure the hoses up top in the engine compartment,13mm for the belt tensioner bolt, 19mm for the crank pulley, and I think two 11 or 10mm nuts that hold the timing cover.

Sounds like a bad rod bearing, but without hearing the noise myself, I can not be sure. If the noise is from the bottom of the motor, it is not a torque converter, but a bearing. On a new rebuild, if the engine is not broken in correctly, the bearings will fail!Depending on the engine and the amount of damage, you may be able to have the bearings replaced, ot you may need to have the crankshaft machined. Either way you are looking a a rather expensive repair. <SEP> how do you stop an engine from knocking? I hear a knocking noise when the engine is reved up.

The engine was rebuilt back in Sept. 05 by the previous owner and he claimes it has not been driven that much until i bought it last month. Any suggestions <EOS>
Unless you have experience operating on an automatic transmission, I wouldn't do it. Manual transmisions are relatively easy if you have a repair manual for the trans you're working on, but an automatic transmision is complicated if you haven't done a few.I would suggest, at the very least, to buy a Haynes or Chiltons repair manual for the 4R55E if you plan to open it up.The link below is good for info on removing the trans and other DIY stuff. <SEP> how do i replace a band in my 4r55e transmission for my 95 ford explorer? its either i do it myself or i pay about 200 to have it done but i have to remove the transmission myself unless itll be more money <EOS>

not to get too technical and mention hydrometers and specific gravity etc draper do a smashing little tool with leds on i which costs about £10 and tells you if the battery is ok or the altenator is playing up. if the battery is off the car best bet is to have it in a shed or somewhere out of the house, check the level and make sure it just covers the plates, remove the caps ( a battery generates gas when charging) keep away from naked lights when charging and if your charger has a variable rate set it on the lowest setting for 4 hrs, then slowly at 4 hr intervals increas the charge, if you dont have that setting on the charger and it is fiarly modern it will do it automatically and leave for 24 hrs then test, if it hasnt charged it has what we call suplhated and needs replacing <SEP> how do you know when your car bettery is fully charged? my car battery has been dead for about a month. does anyone know how long it takes too charge i have just past so i am dying to get cruising!!

Replacing the evaporator is an extreamly involved procedure best left to a pro,in most cases the dashboard itself needs to be removed  and more importantly,the r12 refrigerant that may still be inside the system will need to be removed with special equipment so its done without it escaping into the atmosphere.Costs are another consideration as it wont be cheap,figure upwards of $1000 (give or take) even if you do it yourself. <SEP> how to replace  evaperator on auto  87 labaron? <EOS>

1)Check underneath the sink where the dishwasher drains to; either tha garbage disposer or a branch tee on the strainer side. Remove the hose. Check for any blockage. If that dont work check it on the DW end. While you got it off, see if you can run water through it. Reinstall the hose. Turn DW on. 2) Move the timer to where it normally drains. You should hear a "clunk" noise. If not remove the kickplate. On the motor itself is a cellanoid with an arm attached to it. This is the drain cellanoid. Turn the DW back on and manually raise or lower the arm while its still on the drain cycle. It should do it itself. If the DW drains while you manually raise or lower the arm then the cellanoid needs replaced. 3) If it moves on its own but the motor doesnt turn, Turn the DW off.

Actually, a wetter mix of cement will adhere better than a stiff mix. Found this out through trial and error while patching my stucco, a stiff mix will just fall off. You can do this, just trowel it on. If you find it's not working, you might need to tack on some wire mesh. However, I agree that this would only be a temporary fix, it will soon start cracking along with the brick. I'd go with some other kind of veneer, T-111 or siding, something that won't crack with the brick.

What size engine?You can take the tension off of the belt and spin the pulley.  If it rolls easy and doesn't wobble it might not be the pulley.  There should be a diagram of the belt path someplace under the hood if not note the belt routing (It’s IMPORTANT)Also note that if that belt comes off while you're driving you lose your power steering your water pump alternator etc.Assuming you're still feeling brave and aren't afraid of skinning your knuckles (Oh Yeah you'll do that) Most newer gm engines use a single idler pulley that doubles as the belt tensioner. When you go to the auto parts store they are just going to sell you the pulley itself so you'll have to use the old tensioner arm.Your first step is to get the belt off.  There will be a bolt on the center of the pulley.  Some of these bolts have a reverse thread on them. Put a large wrench of the exact size on the bolt (If you use standard wrench on a metric bolt you'll strip the bolt and hurt your hand, (you were warned....) You have to pull on the wrench to take the tension off of the belt, at the same time pull the belt off of a pulley or two then slowly ease off of the wrench, don't let it slam back.After that just take the pulley bolt out, replace the pulley, reverse the process making sure you follow the belt path.While you're at it check the belt itself this could be the source of your noise and you may want to replace it now.  Also note that if your belt is bad it is most likely time to replace your radiator hoses.You may want to check out your local library for a shop manual for your car.  It will show you lots of pretty pictures ;-)Good Luck. <SEP> how do i change an idler pulley? my idler puuley is make noise , how do i change it. I can see it but i cant get to it.

Termites need moisture from the soil to survive, so they build mud tunnels to go back and forth between the ground and your house. The tunnels also protect them from bright sunlight which they hate worse than a vampire does. So the first thing you do is simply go around the outside perimeter of your concrete foundation and scratch off any of their mud tunnels you find on the surface or in cracks at corners etc with a screwdriver or putty knife blade. They like dark crawl spaces under porches or room additions where they can get to the moist earth and build their mud tunnels straight up to the wooden floor joists. Of course any wood in direct contact with the ground is a highway to your house for them.Termites can survive in a house without having the mud tunnels going back to the ground if there's a source of water from a leaking roof or pipe etc. The worker termites are small white larvae looking things, and in the spring you'll typically see them swarming (flying) which says that they're around alright. <SEP> how do i know if there are termites in my house? <EOS>
Easy to do if you are talking about painting black or grey trim. They make a special bumper and trim paint that is flexible so it works on plastic and expands and contracts with temperature. You can find it at any auto parts store (Advance Auto, etc).Preparation is the key to a good result. You need to go to the auto parts store and buy a paint preparation precleaner. Scrub your trim with soap and water and a plastic scrubby pad. Then rinse and dry and follow up with the paint prep product following label directions.Use masking tape and newspapers to mask off your trim so you don't get overspray on your paint.

Assuming you've already checked the wiring and it's fine, theres a trick I've used a few times before. First, make sure there is NO power going to the fixure.

My advice would be to trace the handbrake cables from your rear calipers forward, they should meet at a point close to where your hand brake is under the car or in some cases they might go into the car in which case remove any plastic surroundings from around your handbrake inside the car and it should be there.

Hey if you can check the automatic transmission fluid, you're doing better than 50% of Americans.I hope you checked it while it was warm and with the engine RUNNING! (The proper way to check an automatic transmission)If it was low, you add fluid through the dipstick hole. Typically with the use of a funnel. However, be sure that you don't OVERFILL the transmission or you'll experience a slipping transmission.Most transmissions go from the dipstick "low" to the dipstick "high" in a single PINT! This is half of what they sell. Typically transmission oil is sold in QUARTS. So if you are on the low side of the dipstick, only pour 1/2 of the bottle into your transmission to raise it up to the high mark. If you are only 1/2 down the dip stick marks, only pour 1/4 of your bottle into the transmission. (etc.)To change the trans fluid is a little more intensive than a simple oil change, and I recommend taking it to a mechanic if you are not mechanically inclined. <SEP> How do I add/change transmission fluid?

well if the engine runs and you want to set the timing then you will need a timing light, first connect your timing light to the battery and the number one spark plug wire, clean off your timing marks on the harmonic balancer and timing indicator and outline with chalk or something that is visible this is just  a suggestion and is not required, loosen the distributor clamp about a quarter turn and then start the engine, point your timing light at the marks and see where the lines are on the balancer and your indicator, I do not know the specification on your car but 0 degrees or slightly advanced is generally a good starting point. If your car backfires or when the starter engages and the engine turns over real slow then that is a good indication that your timing is off or a fault somewhere in the ignition system. <SEP> how to set timming on a 1979 nova V6? <EOS>

Go to a Car stereo shop.  The reason you would go there is because sound dampening is part of high end car audio systems.  The last thing you want is road noise on your expensive car audio system.There are items you can buy such as spray on material, adhesive pads, and non-adhesive fabric type material.  Dynamat is the big popular provider of sound dampening materials, but there are online places like partsexpress.com which will sell you cheaper no-name dampening material.  Just look it up in their car-audio section.You will likely find that decreasing the noise is gonna cost you a good chunk of change and a lot of work.  Usually you need to 'dampen' (add sound deadening material) the doors and floor.  You can also do the roof if that is the main source of your problem.

Look to see if there is a tee in the incoming water line before the water shutoff and regulator. If there is, that line is going to a hose bib ( spigot ) to the outside of the house. That will give you a real pressure reading from the meter. Pressure testers are available at Home Depot, etc. and just attach to the spigot like a hose. Turn on the water and get the reading. If you can change the water pressure be careful . If you have a spigot at some other location around the house, it will be the water pressure after the regulator. Check it as you increase the pressure. I wouldn't go above 65 or 70 psi. If that doesn't do it, your water pressure in the lines isn't the problem. <SEP> How can you increase water pressure in a house? I already had a pressure regulater installed and that didn't help... <EOS>

I have used Victor's Rockcast Exhaust Repair Kit with success. It works like the old plaster casts a doctor used to put on broken limbs. The kit comes with a roll of cloth tape with the "plaster" embedded. You cut it into strips and wet it with a solution of water and hardener. It stays soft long enough to wrap it around the damaged pipe/muffler, then hardens to full strength over a period of hours. It's not a permanent repair, but is useful in a pinch. This page at Victor Automotive shows this as well as several other exhaust repair products. Autozone, Advance, etc stock these. http://www.victorautomotive.net/pdfs/vic/ver2.pdfJB Weld is a good product, too. For small holes, it would probably be your best bet. Any hardware or auto parts store and discount stores like WalMart sell JB Weld. http://jbweld.net/index.phpWhatever you use, the repair will last a lot longer if you make sure the area where you're gonna apply anything is clean. <SEP> how can i make a quick fix on a exhaust leak without taking it to the shop? <EOS>

Take precautions for protecting carpets or flooring as the water in the radiator may be black. Close both valves, noting if the lock shield valve is only part open,  slacken the nut between the valve and the radiator at one each, catch the water into a dish until the radiator is empty. open vent to aid draining. when empty remove connection at the other end and plug with tissue as there will always be a last drop, remove first end slackened and plug. close vent up, lift rad off brackets and turn upside down.   Replace in revers using jointing paste on valve connections, open one valve and vent the radiator recharging the system if its a sealed system ( combi boiler) when the radiator is full close vent and open the other valve. Check pressure on boiler if applicable. check for leaks and turn heating on.  The heating system can still be used whilst the radiator is off. <SEP> How do you detach then re-attach radiators to the wall? <EOS>
You said vinyl floor right, well don't use thinner, it will breakdown the vinyl and make it rubbery. Hopefully you still have a glossy shine to your floor, that makes it so the paint cannot bond with the floor very well. Wet the area with water, then using a spray bottle, mist the paint with rubbing alcohol (80% or greater). It will react with the paint but not the floor causing a chemical reaction with the latex in the paint, making the latex rubberize. You can the use an ice scraper to remove the paint. it should peel right off the floor with a little elbow grease. <SEP> How do I remove paint from vinyl floor?

If the engine takes too long to heat up then it probably is a bad thermostat. Watch the temp Gage and see if the temperature is in the proper range when the temperature gets up to the proper operating temp then the thermostat will open up letting the water circulate through the engine.You can tell when this happens as you may be able to hear the thermostat click and followed by a sudden and temporary drop in temperature as the cooler water from the radiator starts going through the engine and the warmer water from the engine goes to the radiator to be cooled by the fan also you may sense a sudden and temporary drop in engine speed when the fan kicks in . <SEP> How do I know when to change the thermostat or know when it isn't working?? I flushed my radiator about three times until water was clear and then refilled with half and half, coolant/distilled water. I did this because it hadn't been done since I bought the truck ('95 Ford Ranger, 107K miles) from a neighbor two years before, plus the fact that the truck's coolant temp gauge needle was going past the middle mark but not all the way into "H." Afterwards, it was a little better, but it still happened once in a while for long trips on the highway. Just changed the air filter w/ a K&N filter and strangely things seemed to improve, but the needle still moves a little past the middle. I don't know what else to do. So, I'm wondering about the thermostat... <EOS>

Some brushes for rollers are junk so if you can buy a good one and a brush that I have found that works great and does minimal sheading of lint on the wall is a black brush by Ralph Lauren which is used for the denim faux wall paint.

As some of the others have stated, if your oil is a "creamy tan goo" on the dipstick, then coolant is getting inside the engine, and will quickly ruin the engine bearings from lack of lubrication.

If I'm reading your question right, there may be a pretty easy remedy. To correct the hitting near the top of the jamb, remove a hinge screw (closest to the interior of the house) and drive a 3 or 3 1/2 inch screw through the jamb and into the framing beyond. Usually tightening the screw will pull that hinge away from the opposite jamb and correct the scrubbing. However, when you pull the hinge there is a tendency to lift the other side of the door, so watch the margin between the top of the door and the top jamb so you don't create another scrubbing problem there.    The gap at the bottom is not as easy. To correct this you'll need to remove the casing from the hinge side of the door. If you cut the caulking where the casing meets the wall before you pry on it, you'll minimize the damage to the wall finish.  After the casing is off, place a pry bar, screwdriver, or whatever behind the  bottom hinge (between the jamb and framing) and push the hinge toward the other side of the jamb. Watch the gap and see if this helps. If so, drive a wedge behind the hinge and secure it with a small nail. Again, pay attention to the margin at the top of the door to make sure it's not binding. If everything looks OK, cut the excess off the wedge and reinstall the casing. Hope this helps <SEP> How can I straighten my front door?

We get wasp nests all the time under our eaves. Go to a hardware store and pickup wasp and hornet spray.

Have a pole/broomstick handle and plastic handy. Aim a steady stream at the nest until no more wasps fall out of th nest usually 3 min depending on the size of the nest.

Some videos (like the Vevo ones) get streamed; I haven't figured out how to save them yet.  But for the bulk of videos, they get saved to the computer's temporary folder until the video is navigated away from. On a Linux or Mac OS X computer, it's relatively easy to find and copy the temporary file elsewhere (renaming it to a .flv if it is a Flash video).  On Windows, the file's locked, so you need to use something like HoboCopy to copy it, which requires administrator rights and command-line usage.

Although many people may suggest tapcon screws or things such as this... you need excersize caution... this may damage the carpet if you are drilling through the carpet... the best thing to do would be cut the threshold to file... use something (pencil, nail. etc.) to mark the carpet under the nail holes (in the threshold)... then cut a small piece of the carpet away from where you will be drilling... *(a drill straight through carpet can cause carpet to ravel or pull strings/lines out of the face)*... after you do this... drill a hole with a concrete bit... then install wooden pegs in the hole (you can buy these wooden pegs in hardware/home improvement stores)... drive them in with a hammer... then use your screws... drive the screws into the wood... and this will hold the threshold in place... <SEP> How do I put down a threshold over carpet on a concrete floor? i am trying to lay a door threshold crossing carpet and tile. the floor beneath is concrete.

Some appliances, notably microwave ovens and CRT-type TVs (normal TVs), have electrical storage parts called "capacitors" inside them and also very high (higher than 110VAC) voltages. The combination means that even unplugged these appliances harbor dangers within. Like applpro said, I'd be *very* hesitant to recommend that a DIYer open either of those appliances for the simple reason that you might give yourself a nasty shock.That said, if the microwave has a fuse, it is almost certainly either in an outside-accesible holder (on the backside), or very near the 110VAC service entrance, well away from the (hopefully shielded) high voltage supply for the microwave generator.  Carefully examine the backside for a fuse holder cover. If not found, take it to an appliance repair person.You should confirm that the power outlet used by the microwave is ok.But, I doubt it has a fuse. If the microwave is "dead", probably some part of the powersupply has died, or perhaps some part of the brain.  In either case, diagnosing the problem can be a real chore, repair would likely require replacing whole circuit boards rather than single components ($), the manufacturers don't generally sell the boards to DIYers (liability risk), and when it's all done you've invested more effort than you would buying a new microwave oven. <SEP> How can I fix a microwave that seems to have a fuse blown?

you first nedd to assess the condition of the bodywork, does the paint have any bubbles ? is there any corrosion that needs repairing such as wheel areches etc ( you dont say what the vehicle is and the age) asuming there is no serious corrosion then you have a lot of sanding to do, if the paintwork and bodywork is in good condition then you need to basically take the shine off the paintwork and ideally coat it with etch primer, the trouble is not knowing what the paint is on the vehicle as some modern paints react with older ones, if this is the case you will need to go back to bare metal to cure the bubbling effect this has, the process is not complicated but it is time consuming, from bare metal you would using body filler (mix in proportions of  filler = size of a golf ball, hardner = size of a pea) you apply the filler to the damaged area and allow to set hard, using as fine a grade of production paper as posssible (less scratches to get rid of later) you sand the repait until it is flat with the panel surface (ifi its curved use something like a piece of plastic pipe, if flat use a rubbing block) you keep repeating this process until the repair is unoticble when you run your hand over it, all repairs must be as good as that.  Next you prime the area using a fine dust coat so that and high or low spots can be seen and repaired this can be done by using a filler putty, this coat needs to be rubbed down with wet and dry (use soap as well it stops the paper clogging) and this process is repeated until all the repairs are complete, then if you wish you can begin applying coats of primer rubbing down with a fine paper in between (soap again) and finally panel wipe (solvent so take care) and tak rag the surface ready for painting, i reccomend several coats of primer to give a deep finish <SEP> How do I prep a car for spraying?

I think I'd get right to the nearest GM dealership. It should still be under warranty. If you must have an appointment to get in the shop, park it in a garage or carport. Got neither?... Cover the open roof with a trash bag...if the bag will fit inside the front doors, close the ends of the bag in the doors or windows to hold it in place. If the bag is too short to reach both doors, put something bigger like a light quilt over the plastic bag. Just make sure that something waterproof is over the hole and is installed in a way that it won't leak into the interior. You may even duct tape around the plastic to cover the opening (I would only do this if I was dead sure there were no other options because the tape may be difficult to remove.)

Instructions STEP 1: Spread a thick layer of fresh sawdust or kitty litter over the grease to absorb excess grease or oil on the surface. STEP 2: Allow the sawdust or kitty litter to sit for a day or two. STEP 3: Gently sweep away the dirty sawdust or kitty litter. STEP 4: Pour dry cement over the entire dried grease spot. STEP 5: Allow the cement to sit for a day or two. STEP 6: Gently sweep away the dirty cement. STEP 7: Gather dirty cement in a bag and throw it away. Do not allow the dirty dry cement to go down the sewer. Tips & Warnings The kitty litter and sawdust soak up grease on the surface, whereas the dry cement actually absorbs the stain out of the driveway. For best results, clean up grease stains as soon as they happen. Avoid further staining by using large automotive drip pans for vehicles that leak. Make sure the forecast is clear for the days you'll be using dry cement on the grease spots if they are outdoors. Dry cement and water will create hardened concrete. <SEP> How do you remove oil stain from asphalt surface? Its in a carport. <EOS>

If I understand the question, you want to know what the problem may be when the problem IS NOT that the system is undercharged? If the system is fully charged is your compressor cycling? If not, do you have power to the compressor? The system may have enough charge but if the pressures on the high side and the low side are not right the system will not operate properly. If the high side pressure is too high there is probably a restriction and a high pressure switch will shut the compressor off to prevent more pressure from building up. How do you know it doesn't need to be charged? If a shop looked at it they probably checked the pressure (or they should have) so find out what they were. Need more info for a more specific diagnosis. <SEP> How do you know what parts to replace on air conditioning in your vehicle, when its not a charge needed?

For instructions on line go to www.autozone.com. It has info for the 1994. I believe they will work for the 1996If equipped with an air bag, disconnect the negative battery cable and properly disable the Supplemental Restraint System (SRS), as detailed in Chassis Electrical . Loosen the lug nuts, then raise and support the vehicle safely. Remove the wheel. As required, separate the brake hose clamp from the strut or knuckle by removing the retaining bolts. Remove the lower caliper retaining bolt and pivot the caliper upward, off the pads. Clean the caliper thoroughly; remove any rust from the lip of the disc or rotor. Check the brake rotor for grooves or cracks. If any heavy scoring is present, the rotor must be replaced. Install the pad retainers. Apply a brake-quiet compound (available at most auto parts strores) to both surfaces of the shims and the back of the disc brake pads. Do not get the compound on the braking surface of the pad. Install the pads and shims. The pad with the wear indicator goes in the inboard position. Push in the caliper piston so the caliper will fit over the pads. This is most easily accomplished with a large C-clamp. As the piston is forced back into the caliper, fluid will be forced back into the master cylinder reservoir. It may be necessary to siphon some fluid out to prevent overflowing. Pivot the caliper down into position and tighten the mounting bolt to 33 ft. lbs. (45 Nm). Connect the brake hose to the strut or knuckle, if removed. Install the wheel and lower the vehicle to the ground. Check the master cylinder and add fluid as required, then install the master cylinder cover. Depress the brake pedal several times and make sure that the movement feels normal. The first brake pedal application may result in a very "long" pedal due to the pistons being retracted. Always make several brake applications before starting the vehicle. Bleeding is not usually necessary after pad replacement. Braking should be moderate for the first 5 miles or so until the new pads seat correctly. The new pads will bed best if put through several moderate heating and cooling cycles. Avoid hard braking until the brakes have experienced several long, slow stops with time to cool in between. Taking the time to properly bed the brakes will yield quieter operation, more efficient stopping and contribute to extended brake life. If equipped, enable the SRS system and connect the negative battery cable <SEP> how do you repolace brakes on a 1996 honda sedan v6? <EOS>

I like to use carnuba car wax.  Since your furniture will be exposed to the same elements as your car, the auto wax will give the bamboo the same protection against the sun and rain.  It doesn't hurt the wood, gives it a nice shine that will bead up water but on really light areas it may darken the bamboo.  Depending on how exposed your bar is to the elements, particularly sun which makes it brittle over time, you will have to treat it about every 6 months.

You add more salt pellets to the holding tank as they are used up.  You should never have to remove the pellets that are in there.  If your tank is only 1/5th full, you should add more to fill it back up.  If you are getting contaminates through your tap you will need to install/replace your filter.  Remember, a water softener is not a water filter.  If the contaminates (probably sand) are a permanent problem, than I would install a filter.  If you install it where water first comes to your house from the main, then you are stopping contaminates from the source.  Wait and see if this is a permanent problem though.  New construction in the area or servicing to water mains or hydrants will cause sediment in water mains to come loose and eventually find their way to your taps.

Squeaky floors are fairly common, and there aren't many homes that do not have at least one. Although they're aggravating, they do not necessarily indicate anything seriously wrong with the floor or its structure.Many things can cause a floor to squeak: warped boards that rock when stepped on; cheaply manufactured floor strips with ill-fitting tongues and grooves; a subfloor separated from the joists due to settling; or weakened joists that have dried out, rotted, or have faulty bridging. Because squeaks usually are caused by boards rubbing against each other, they can easily be silenced by lubricating or reattaching the boards.Locate the squeak by having someone walk over the noisy area of the floor while you listen and watch from below. Look for springy boards, movement between joists, and bridging that sags when weight is applied. As a precaution, inspect the area around the squeak for structural damage which may require the replacement of girders, posts, or bridging.The following six scenarios should help you troubleshoot and fix your squeaky floor.    1) Shimming the Subfloor Simple wood shims, wedged into gaps between a joist and loose subfloor boards, will stop all movement between the boards—and the squeaking it causes.a. Locate the squeak.b. Gently tap in shims to just fill the space between the joists and subfloor. Do not drive the shims too forcefully or they may further separate the boards from the joist and widen the gap you're trying to eliminate. A dab of adhesive on both sides of each shim will further anchor the boards.2) Cleating the SubfloorIf the squeak is caused by diagonally laid boards in the subfloor, you can eliminate movement of the boards with 1x4 or 1x6 cleats. a. Locate the squeaky boards.b. Place the cleat along the joist supporting the loose boards. Prop the cleat in place with a piece of 2x4 so it lies snugly against the joist and the subfloor.c. Using 8d nails, nail the cleat to the joist. Drive the nails while the cleat is firmly wedged into the right angle formed by the floor and the joist.d. Once the cleat is solidly attached, remove the 2x4 prop.   3) Bridging the Joists If you notice squeaking over a large area, the joists beneath the floor may be slightly shifting and inadequately supporting the subfloor. Stabilize the subfloor by attaching steel bridging between the joists, preventing them from moving side to side. a. Affix the first bridging. Hammer its straight-pronged end into the top of a joist. Drive its L-shaped, flanged end into the bottom of the opposite joist. The steel bridging should create tension between the opposing joists.b. Install companion bridging in a crisscross fashion.c. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for other joists, as needed. The result should be a series of firmly braced joists that are less likely to give beneath weight on the floor.  4) Installing Screws from Below When individual boards are loose or bulging, the resulting squeak can be fixed by tightening the boards with screws inserted from below. Use wood screws of a length that will penetrate the subfloor board but stop 1/4 inch below the surface of the finish floor. a. Drill a pilot hole into the subfloor the size of the screw shank. Put tape on the bit at 3/4 inch so you won't drill into the finish floor.b. Drill a pilot hole in the finish floor with a bit slightly smaller than that used for the subfloor. Tape the bit at 1-1/4 inches so you'll stop within 1/4 inch of the finished surface.c. Insert the screw through a large-diameter washer, and turn it into the hole. As you tighten the screw, it will bite into the finish floorboards and pull them down.  5) Nailing Through the Finish Floor. If you cannot gain access to the subfloor, straight nails can be driven through the finish floor to anchor loose boards. a. On hardwood floors, drill a pilot hole narrower than the nail to reduce the chance of spli <SEP> How do i stop floorboards creaking - they're covered with carpet? <EOS>

Describing how to change a timing belt here is not practical. But try your local library for auto repair manuals (a very good one is "How to keep your VW alive", but I don't know if there is an edition for a 95 golf).

Well, I guess by the sounds of people here, I'm a rarity. I'm honest and good. I have never ripped a single person off and I now teach it at our local community college. The best advice is to be upfront with them. If you don't like their personality, go somewhere else. You really need to go in person to meet them, as often we are to busy to talk on the phone and are constantly bothered by price shoppers. it's just like finding a doctor you like. Sometimes you have to go to several of them to find one that your personalities mesh with. Once you find one, reward them with your loyalty. A good customer/provider relationship benefits both parties. We know your history of the car and you know we won't rip you off. We'll also know if we need to call you when repairs get expensive or if you are the type who doesn't need a phone call. Hope this helps. All you can do is try and see.

If you take the number of amps printed on your circuit breaker times the your voltage (probably 110v), that will equal the amout of watts your appliances can put out before they exceed the rating of the breaker.

The heat was probably off for the season (when it was cold).Now that its on, it sounds like your thermostat is broken.Remember getting upset won't help to get this fixed.. so you need to talk to the landlord and mention that you believe the thermostat is broken, and that there is more heat than you need is coming into the apartment.

Long-term solution:1. Caulk the outside window frame, where it meets the house. Caulk all joints and seams in the outside of the window.2. Check the glazing compound inside and out to be sure it is attached to both the glass and frame.3. Caulk the inside joint around the window where it meets the wall. 4. Seal any cracks or seams in the non-moving parts of the window and sashes. 5. Use a weatherseal (I like V-Seal) to line the sides and bottom of the moving sashe, and the joint between the two sashes.That gives you a weather-tight window that will last a long time (depending at least in part on the quality of the caulks and materials), AND saves money in the summer as well.Additional insulation can be provided by outside mounted plastic sheeting, inside mounted shrink film plastic, good curtains, etc. <SEP> how to stop cold air from coming from windows that wasn't properly sealed to keep out air? <EOS>

if you're looking to disconnect your battery, first located where your batter is located, read the owners manual. the matrix is probably located in front of the car.  the only toy i knew with battery in back is the little mr2.  once you found the battery, i would disconnect the black wire attached to the battery then the red one.  but really no need to take out both wires if you want to clear the code.  one wire will do.  once you got that disconnect let it sit for a little while before you hook it back up.  if you want to get rid of light on the dash, give it 10 minute.  if you go into a smog shop with the light on, that is guarantee failure.  they will charge you first then tell you.  if that doesnt work, then you would have to get it clear by a scan tool.  good luck <SEP> How do I disconnect the car battery?

You do not need to remove the back seat. You have to remove the back wheel and the plastic innner wheel well though. It may be hard to manuver in the small space were the filter is if you have large hands. You will need to depress the tabs on the lines where they connect to the filter. There are 2 of them on each line that are 180 degrees from each other. Chances are you have new lines that came with the filter. They made a change in the filter to a longer one and the lines need to be used to fit it. Make sure you connect the lines to the filter before setting it in place.  After filter is in place.

Wow, this has happened to me before!  Actually more than once!First, don't run any water or anything down the drain.  The contact might be already gone, but there's a possibility that it's still in the P-trap underneath the sink.  If you put anything down the sink there's a possibility that it might wash out into the pipes and be lost..The P-trap is the curved pipe you see underneath the sink.  Disconnect the P-trap underneath the sink.  First, put something under there to catch the water that will fall out when you disconnect it.  The P-trap is usually held onto the pipes with some rings.  All you have to do is unscrew the rings.  You might need to use a pliers or vice grip to do this.  After you unscrew the rings, just slide the P-trap off the pipe, and dump the water from the P-trap into your bucket or whatever.  Examine this water for your contact lens.Also, sometimes the contact can get stuck to the pipe inside the sink.  There's gunk on there that the contact will sometimes stick to.  So if you don't find it in the P-trap, check the pipe that goes from the sink to the P-trap.  If the contact is in there, you can dislodge it with a long tool (a stick, pencil, whatever).If it's not in that pipe or the P-trap, you probably won't get it back.  Also, if you're not completely sure that it went into the sink, check the floor and other surfaces in the bathroom.  Sometimes it can seem like they fell in there when they really fell somewhere else.  If you shine a flashlight around it makes it easier to locate the contact because it will reflect the light from the flashlight.  You can see the glint of the light off the contact and that's how you'll know where it is.If you find your contact, of course, you will want to clean the contact lens thoroughly before putting it back into your eye.I hope you find it! <SEP> How do I retreive a lost hard contac lens from the sink drain? <EOS>

Sounds like the idle mixture screws then.There are two screws on the base of the carb. Typically on the front. While the engine is running, screw one of them in (turn clockwise) one half turn at a time. Count the half turns. Keep turning until the engine starts to run rough. Back it off a half turn.Do this for the other screw. Then go back to the first and using quarter turns, turn clockwise and then back off when the engine runs rough. Do this for the other screw.Should be set fine now.You could also turn both screws all the way in, and then back off one and one half turns. Then start the engine and try quarter turns as explained above.Count the number of turns it took for each screw to tighten. Don't tighten too much. If worse comes to worse and the engine is running like a dog, put them back to where you started.

My wax melts at 124 dgrees F. Any ideas of something I can coat the inside of the tins with before pouring the wax and adheres to the tins well and will hold up to the melting candle?

start with the ceiling, tack up with nails at least 8 per sheet then screws 8-12in on center in the field and six in. on center around the edges. make sure that they are hitting the studs or trusses. a 2x4 1-2in short of the ceiling with a 2ft piece nailed to the top like a T will help hold it up. make sure the nails and screws are just a little below the surface of the sheet rock.  to cut it either use a sheet rock square or snap a chauk line and cut through the paper and a little in the rock then bend it toward the uncut side it may need a little pop from your knee to snap it, then cut the paper on the uncut side with your knive. the easyiest way and quickest way is to hire someone with experiance. <SEP> how to hang sheetrock? <EOS>

There are several types of sightglass'.  One has glass on both sides of a round brass-looking body.  It may have a dot in it.  If the dot looks magnified, the system is full.  If there are bubbles in it more than a minute or two after the compressor starts running, the charge is low.  If the bubbles are constant, or if the dot does not look magnified, the system is empty.The other type has a round center in the body of the sightglass, and just the top is glass, and it will have a colored dot in the center; this dot is the moisture indicator.  This dot varies in color depending on the manufacturor of the sightglass, but usually should have a plastic cap that covers the sightglass to keep it clean.  The cap will tell what color is normal and what color it will change to if it senses moisture in the system.  If it indicates moisture, have it checked by a pro; moisture can react with the chemical makeup of the refrigerant, and can form an acid, which can reek havoc on your compressor, and that can be very expensive to repair.  Getting rid if the moisture now will be cheaper than a new comp., or new unit <SEP> how do i read my central air sightglass? <EOS>

Even most shop manuals do not cover removing body components such as this. If you want factory information for it you can go to www.motorcraft.com and access the factory manuals for 19.95 for 3 days. Most lamps are secured by either a screw through the lens to the bummper or by vertical screws behind the bumper into the lamp housing. You can raise the car and remove the lower cover panels and reach the lamps from the bottom. If you are still not able to access the lamp screws the bumper is really not hard to remove. There are several pop in clips along the upper and lower edges and at the wheel housing plastic covers then usually 2 bolts that hold the bumper up to the fender on each side. Once you have those out the bumper should slide forward off the car. <SEP> How do I replace a 94 Ford Probe Blinker/ light cover? From the looks of it, I may have to remove the entire front bumper.

The answer is in ScottE's brief note.  Your house's problem is in the ducting and dampers.  I suspect a few breaks (disconnected branch ducts).Start at the heater and trace the duct runs, test each damper to make sure they are open, look for "blowholes" or disconnected ducts.  Connect the disconnected, cover the holes (sheet metal patch pieces, screws and seal edges with duct tape), open the dampers.If you do all that and still have trouble, call in a Heating & Ventilating contractor.  Tell him to give you a quote for duct cleaning.  (They have brushes on a wound cable something like a dry Roto-Rooter.)  What I suspect, at that point, is that something large has gotten inside a duct (someone dropped clothes down a floor register or an animal crawled in there).  The HV contractor will find it and you'll have cleaner air circulating in the house.The typical house should have the ducts cleaned every 5 years for the sake of Indoor Air Quality. <SEP> How do I fix my heating system if one room gets very hot and others remain really cold?

I assume you mean AC compressor, not air compressor, unless you're driving a constuction vehicle with an air compressor for power tools or something.The "hissing" noise is probably just the vacuum switch inside the dashboard that switches vents on & off, or is controlling outside/inside air intake - perfectly normal.

Gmail backups have become a somewhat timely topic, as thousands of Gmail users had their account reseted by accident recently.  Here's one more backup solution from the comments to that Engadget post:   I have all my GMail emails forwarded to my Hotmail account, of which all of the emails are downloaded locally on 2 different computers. I've had my Hotmail account since 1998, and I've never lost anything or had a problem so if GMail goes down, Hotmail will still work, and if that goes down, I have it all backed up.

There are many kinds of flush valve gaskets to choose from.  If you have a local plumbing supply they should have a better variety than a hardware store.  Take the original up there.  The old Cranes had a special gasket designed just for their toilets. It's thicker than the new universal gaskets that do not fit all toilets properly.  I think the old American Standard gaskets will work on crane,but don't take my word on that.  You do not want to tighten the nut to much or it will crack the tank. I tighten until the tank does not wiggle. <SEP> How do I repair a leaking toilet flush valve beveled gasket due to a chip in the edge of the mounting hole? I replaced the flush valve in an old Crane toilet. The original beveled gasket between the flush valve and the hole in the bottom of the tank was a softer material that sealed well despite there being a small chip in the inside tank edge of the flush valve mounting hole. The replacement flush valve uses a harder rubber beveled gasket that only contacts the edge of the tank hole, so water now leaks through the chipped area.I cannot tighten the flush valve locknut enough to compress the gasket to seal into the chipped area and cannot find a softer beveled gasket. I am thinking about filling in the chip with J B Weld to bring the surface back to normal. Would that work? Or should I try something different? <EOS>

You can't disable auto saving, but you can have it happen offline.  Make sure that you have offline Google Docs enabled and that your document is downloaded.  Then, disconnect the internet.  Start editing that document.  Now, you will be editing the offline version.  At this point, you can safely reconnect to the internet.  This will NOT force you to edit the online version of the document; you will still be editing the offline version until you click on the "reconnect to online docs" link (or whatever it's called).  Thus, you can edit offline even when online.  At the end of the day, when you are finished editing, you can reconnect and sync the chances with the online version.  This achieves offline editing without any of the mess of downloading, uploading, and having to deal with conversion and bad formatting. <SEP> How to disable auto-save in Google Docs? <EOS>

You have to use a programmer or a chip. On that new of a Chevy you can't just remove it.

First thing you need to do is drain oil to proper level. After that remove the spark plugs and clean them since they may be oil fouled already. After that reinstall and run vehicle until it burnes it all out. You are going to have a lot of smoke coming out the tail pipe.

Older homes often have receptacles and fixtures that are ungrounded, and many local codes do not require that they be rewired so they're grounded. Still, grounding is worth adding to your system because it adds protection against electrical shock. Grounding provides a third path for electricity to travel along, so if there is a leak of any sort, it will flow into the earth rather than into the body of a person who touches a defective fixture, appliance, or tool.An electrical system is grounded with a grounding rod driven at least 8 feet into the ground outside the house or connected to a cold water pipe. Each individual branch circuit must be grounded as well, either with a separate wire that leads to the neutral bar of the service panel or with metal sheathing that runs without a break from each outlet to the panel. (In theory, electrical outlets can be grounded individually, but this is impractical.) <SEP> How do you ground a home? I am looking for details about a "ufred" method.

It's old, about 20yrs, but still kicks butt.(I have in the past adjusted the screws on the carb when I was in dire need of it half ass working. But then that was the end of it working well enough so off to the shop we would go.) <EOS>
You might check your wiring, the spot lights should only come on when the headlight high beams come on. verify you have tapped into the hot wire for the highbeams. not the lowbeams or ground. <SEP> How to wire up driving lights to a subaru vortex?

There is an open source clone of Trello, that is actually quite good! It's called Kanban, and it is shockingly similar feel to Trello  https://github.com/somlor/kanban   Very cool.

Fill a squirt bottle with full strength Hydrogen Peroxide from the drug store. (The solution is about 3.5% out of the bottle). Squirt the stain and let rest for about 1 minute. You will now be able to easily scrape off the varnish. Apply the solution again liberally. Let it react for at least 2 hours. Depending on how old and how dense the stain, you may have to sand the spot and reapply the peroxide several times. Then it will be necessary of course to refinish the spot.We have just sanded and refinished a large hardwood floor that has been under a wall to wall carpet for 14 years.

I've been in the "business for 25 years" and have installed hundreds of square feet of this. The former installer did not leave the proper space in the installation process, there should have been a gap left under the trim mold on the sides for expansion.   If you have an escrow account call the Real Estate agent and get the details from them about a new floor or repairs. Or, contact the installer.  Is the floor glued down, this is the big question, if it is, Ooops! I don't know what you can do and keep the looks.

Purchase the correct breaker for the one you are replacing.To be safe, you will need to shut off the main breaker and all the other breakers.  Take the cover off the panel.  Find the breaker you are replacing and unfasten the wire from it (usually a flat screw terminal).  Remove the bad breaker and install the new one in its place.  Reattach the wire to the new breaker.  Install the panel cover.  Starting with the main breaker, turn the main on and then one by one, turn the rest of the breakers on.  It is necessary to do them one at a time to prevent a surge of current that may trip the breakers or the main. <SEP> How do change a circuit breaker switch in my home. one of my switches actually broke? just need to change swch <EOS>
wear a dust mask first. and get your self a lot of strong garbage bags. I would start by hitting the wall with a crowbar to break the plaster and (wearing gloves) start to break off the plaster with your hands and use the crobar if you need to. I would remove all the plaster first then the lath or wooden strips. this process will just make the clean up a little easier to mannage. you can also dampen the walls with water to limit the dust. If you do it in a methodical mannner it wont be such a bitch to clean up. and when you start pulling of the lath as you are removing it lay them in piles so it will be easier to bundle up for removal. Good luck <SEP> How do i gut plaster walls? <EOS>

Locate your head, and you'll see wiring going through to it, unplug those "spark plug wires" and you'll see the spark plugs. Take a spark plug socket (or any socket that could fit) and "unscrew them" replace them. Make sure they are nice and tight and that you plug your wires back in where they should be. I recommend doing one at a time so you don't get your plug wires messed up. <SEP> how do you change spark plugs in a 2001 dodge stratus SE coupe? <EOS>

If the problem isn't in the areator, I would have to say that it is indeed clogged somewhere between the water line hookups and the faucet's head.  There is a chance that silt has built up inside the actual faucet and is clogged somewhere in there.  You might consider turning off the water to that sink, taking apart the faucet (really simple, email me if you need help) and running some drano through the faucet itself.  Obviously, water is indeed flowing or you wouldn't be able to use the sprayer.  It could also be that you just have a bunk faucet head.  Either way, let me know what it is. <SEP> How do you repair a faucet that doesn't leak? I have a faucet that doesn't flow.  I can turn it on and use the sprayer, but no water from anywhere else.

First before you take off the belt make sure you have a belt diagram.  If you can't find it in the engine compartment then you have to draw one.  Your 15 minute job can turn into a hour or more if you don't have one.  If you dont know where the tensioner that keeps the belt tight is pull on the belt and look for a pulley that moves.  Get a wrench or rachet depending on what is there to move the pulley.  Just pry the tensioner and slide the belt off a pulley.  I would recommend you to take off the tensioner it is only one bolt.  If it squeeked when moving it replace it while you have it off.  Also look at a new one and compare the pulleys if it looks like it is seperating replace it.  Also spin the pulley.  If it makes any noise replace the pulley.  Also check all other pulleys especially idler pulleys if they make any noises or wiggle some replace them too.Now to put the belt on use you diagram and route the belt accordingly.  Leave a smooth pulley if you can for last.  Take your wrench and pry the tens. and slipe the belt on the last pulley.  Now check to make sure you belt is straight on all pulleys.  One groove off will destroy you belt in minutes.  Maybe have someone bump the engine while you look at the belt and if at 3 times all is ok then start it.  Walaa you done.Hope that helps.By the way I do like soccer.Todd <SEP> how to install drivebelt 1996 cadillac deville? <EOS>

A 460 and a 429 have the same block.

To  point other posts have been correct, except that you will need a special masonary bit to drill the concrete. When you buy it, as the person selling it to help match it to the size of the expanding anchor bolt. All should go smoothly, probably about two to five minutes for each bolt, depending upon the power of your drill. If you like, you may start each hole with a smaller bit, it will take less muscle and help guide the larger bit, less chance of it dancing about before it bites in. <SEP> How do I go about bolting something into a concrete floor? <EOS>
