Note: @Joe has created a JavaScript bookmarklet which automates the process described below. It is available at joereddington.com->better-gmail-search .  I discovered this slightly more friendly hack after noticing the URL of the inbox: unread first . After expanding the unread section, you'll notice in the location bar there's a #section_query . With the exception of that one part, it's practically the same as a search result URL.  So, the solution is to first input the search terms and search. Then, in the address bar, replace #search with #section_query .  This will provide you with a search page with the same amount of pages as specified in your settings, without the hassle of creating a filter.<SEP>How to set up Gmail to show more than 20 results per page when searching?<EOS>

First read your manual and find out how much and what kind of oil your car needs.  This is very important on newer cars whose tolerance is so small.Then go to the autoparts store and ask for a filter for your car and get the oil you need.  You should also have an oil filter wrench.  I reccomebd the ring kind not the kind tha fits over the top ore the visegrip kind.You might also want to get something conviniant to catch the oil in and tote it around.  You will need to take it back to a place that collects old oil.Then get on your back and find the drain plug.  Wait till you car is cool though.  Undo the plug and let the oil drain into the pan you got.  Next you need to find your oil filter.  You have a new one so you should be able to look for something the same shape.  it may be a different color though.Turn the old filter counter clock wise.  be ready though oil will come out a small amount anyway.Turn it over on your drain pan and let the rest run out of the filter.Put a small amount of oil on your finger and rub the gasket on the new filter.  Put it where the old one was and hand tighten only.  If it is easy to do without spilling oil you you should also prime the filter by pouring some oil into it.Replace the filter and the drain plug.  Fill you car oil fill (under the hood) to the recommended amount.  Replace the cap.  I have forgotten to do that a couple of times.

My personal favorite lately has been When2meet .  Time selection is easily clickable/draggable, reporting is intuitive and visual, and there's minimal setup involved (read: practically none).  There is no contact list integration, but you can send the short, private link directly to your recipients.  And, of course, it's free!  The only criterion listed above which I'd say it falls a bit short on is the ability for the organizer to specify time intervals that are "on the table".  You can specify a list of dates, and a range of times on those dates, but that range must be contiguous and the same across dates.  In effect, the organizer doesn't get special priority in limiting the choices.  Although it wasn't one of your criteria, it also lacks time zone support, so it's really only good for face-to-face or highly localized meetings.<SEP>What is a good webapp for finding the best meeting time for a group of people?

The system is, or should be, self-regulating with regard to pressure and water supply.  I don't think you can affect this.  regardless of pressure, the system will circulate heated water by gravity and convection.  There should be a circulator that forces the hot water through the system and returns the cooled water to the heater.  If your system is that old, it could need flushing-something a heater tech should be called for- or the pipes might simply be clogged with corrosion or mineral deposits which would restrict the flow of water.  The "dripping" noises might be from expansion and contraction of the the pipes as hot or cold water is introduced.

As a owner of a Range Rover and two Disco's I have to say I am supprised to hear that the speedy TR7 has twin carbs.For a book I would suggest you go to the LRO site, or buy one of their mags and look through the too many adverts and you will find books on offer along with many specialty shops that love to work on rover V8s.If you would like to get driving there is a rough and ready way. Pardon me if I miss some points as my book is not with me.Here we go:  Make sure you have just the PROPER amount of oil in each carb chamber, Make sure the linkage is or cable is adjusted so both carbs function as close to as alike as you can determine, now the fun part.Find  yourself some of that small 8mm or so clear plastic hose, about 3/4 of a meter in length get two if you can. Start your engine, put the hose near your ear (one end) and the other end just down the throat of the carb-Forgot to mention you need to have the aircleaner off.  You will hear the hissing of the fuel jet as the engine runs. Listen to each carb in turn.  You objective is to get the sound exactly the same as much as your calibrated ear can allow.Set the idle screws on each carb the same number of turns (remember to count how they were set. Now set the each carb bit by bit to get the engine idle to 600 or so RPM. Keep the sound the same between each of the carbs.The models of SU's on my Range Rover have fuel adjustment screws which I then cut them back till the engine goes rough and then open them evenly (to the sound) untill it goes smooth.  Check your work by reving the engine and listening you may have to fiddle one carb or the other just a little to keep the sound and have smooth exceleration.This can be really fustrating as things like big changes in humidity and temperature effect the fuel tuning.You may find it much more satisfying to take it to a reputable garage and watch as you wax on about the pleasures of owning a classic automoble or even less stress than that, ask when you can pick it up and if it is not too long spend the time in a pub-having lunch of course you should not drink and drive.Good Luck.<SEP>How do I Balance my twin SU's and how do I stop her running rich (Triumph TR7 V8 3500).

Your charge will depend on a number of factors.  First, determine the ambient temperature outside.  Then, put a thermometer on the suction line, the bigger of the two pipes on your outside condenser.  Watch the temp of the suction line as you charge the unit.  At 95 degress outside with 68psi of freon on your low side (big pipe) you should have a line temp of 43 - 45 degrees.  Then check the temperature of the air coming out of the vent closest to your a/c inside your home.  Proper outlet temp will be 55-57 degrees.  Do not charge more than 75psi of freon.  This will cause your a/c to not properly change from vapor to liquid to vapor in the cycle.A/C is a tricky  and time-consuming proposition.  If nothing else, hook your blue hose up to the large line Schrader valve (looks like a tire valve) on the outside unit.  Charge it to 70psi and WAIT.  Keep checking the large line temp and the inside vent temp til you get 43-45 degrees outside on the line and 55-59 degrees inside.  Do not over-charge the freon.  As your unit balances the freon in liquid and vapor forms, the pressure will drop, so be patient and use temperature to achieve maximum cooling efficiency.  Stick with 68 - 7O psi on the low-side (large line) on the outside unit if nothing else.  And let it run to allow it to properly balance out the freon.If you get confused, call a tech.  Better to pay him now than make things worse.<SEP>How do I charge a home air conditioner?<EOS>
If you're talking about the flasher relay for the turn signals, the hardest part of replacing it is -finding- it.It should just be a plug-in relay under the dashboard, somewhere around knee level when you're sitting in the driver's seat.  Get a new one from an auto parts store so you know what you're looking for.  They may even have a diagram that shows where it should go.If you don't have a diagram, and if the old one isn't completely bad, you can find it by turning the key to the position where the turn signals work, and turning on the right or left turn signal.  Put your finger on the top of each of the things under the dash that look like the one you bought from the parts store. The flasher will be the one that has the strongest clicking feel.  Remove it by pulling gently. Plug in the new one, being sure to line up the pins on the bottom with the socket under the dash.And you're done. :)<SEP>How do I install a flasher into a 1995 Buick LeSabre?<EOS>

I have always used Bullseye primer/sealer to paint paneling - especially dark paneling because it will cover in one coat. There are no issues with coloring the sealer if it is a earthtone color because anything darker may exceed the recommended maximum amount of coloring you are allowed to add. You can also use Kills sealer but you will need at least 2 coats. The other advantage to using sealer is you do not need to prepare the paneling so it will stick unless the paneling is covered with grease or oil. In that case I would use a degreaser that has orange oil in it.<SEP>How do I paint wood paneling? I know it sounds tacky but it's my only option at this point.

Easy. Change pads? Disc or rotor. First remove the tire/rim. Sometimes they are stuck on so have a deadblow hammer handy.On rotor brakes the calipers must be removed from the rotors. The pads should pop right out. You may need a C-clamp to push the caliper piston in, so have one of those handy too. Replace the pads just as you found the others.For drum brakes, the drum head must be removed. I have found drum brakes easier to change once you have access to the pads.The only other thing to be done besides changing lines if you have a leak, is to bleed the brakes. You need two people for this.One person behind the wheel, and the person at the wheel well releases the nipple on the caliper. Person at wheel pushes brake to floor. You do this several times until you have good brake pressure. Don't forget to retighten the bleeder nipple you loosened. This gets rid of water and air in the lines.Make sure you have plenty of brake fluid in the resevoir.Not too sure what you meant by repair them.....if this doesn't cover it maybe you can be more specific. If you feel this is over your head, just take it to a mechanic. Changing the brake pads or getting brake service done isn't too expensive.<SEP>How do i repair my car brakes?<EOS>

"Crackchecker" is right.  The foot valve is located at the end of the water supply line at the bottom of the well.  The line will need to be pulled out of the well in order to replace it.Replacing the foot valve will be cheaper than installing a submersible pump.  Maintenance on either system requires that the water line and foot valve/submersible pump be pulled out of the well.Good luck with your project.<SEP>how do i replace a foot valve on a well system?<EOS>

regular maintenance is the thing. Especially the oil change every 3000 miles. My toyota van has 242,000 miles on it, and my last one had 250k. Both even had head gasket leaks for over 50k miles! Oil changes, my friend, oil changes.Inline engines last longer in general than V or opposed cylinders, because they have more main bearings than cylinders. More cylinders last longer than less in general, because the wear and load is spread between more cylinders, so they wear slower.I had a 1970 Maverick with an inline 6 cylinder and a 1 bbl carb with automatic transmission. It would pretty much never die, because short of running out of one of the fluids, or forgetting to change one on time, you could never blow the motor even if you floored it everywhere you went. 1 barrel can't dump in enough gas to make it wind up harder than 7 main crank bearings could handle. That was the first car I ever got over 200,000 miles. (then i gave it to my sister and a gas attendant accidentally poured ATF into the brake fluid and all the rubber parts melted, rendering the brakes useless and more expensive than the entire car to replace. she had to give it to a cousin that does demolition derby).<SEP>how can i get 200,000 miles from my car? i want to know if there is anything additional to regular maintenance<EOS>

Get a hammer and a pointed chisel (one for metal or concrete, not wood) and just enlarge the hole.  Depending on if you have 2 hole or 3 hole blocks this will be either easy or hard.  (2 hole blocks have larger holes in the blocks than 3 holers)If it is a 3 hole block you may have to chip out a very large area, install the pipe and then use some cement to fill the voids around the pipe after it is installed.

I just did some repairs to some lath and plaster this morning. You need to pick off any "loose" pieces at the edges of your existing hole. Your 1 foot by 3 foot repair may become larger! It's tough to know when to stop. When you feel you have removed the most loose pieces, it's time to start the repair. You need to purchase some "setting type" joint compound. It comes in a powder that you add water to, and mix to a consistancy that is slightly thinner than peanut butter. It should'nt sag when applied to the wall. Fill the area and put some mesh tape over the edges. The joint compound that you purchase should be a 90 minute setting type. This means it will be dry within that time and you can reapply some more to finish it. I would also suggest using a regular joint compound to "feather out" and finish the area. It's easier to sand. This job is a little tricky. It takes alot of practice to get familiar with the tools and to get a good feel for the material. If you apply the joint compound evenly and smooth at each coat, you should have minimal sanding only after the last coat is applied.   Good luck  (If you have to remove to much plaster I would suggest screwing on a piece of 1/4 inch drywll in the area.)<SEP>How do I repair a lathe and plaster wall?

The white is a neutral wire and goes to the 4 other white wires. It may be hard to find a wirenut big enough to fit 5 wires into one wirenut. You may need to add a pigtail wire and divide the 4 white wires in the box into 2 sets of 2 wires with wirenuts (using the pigtail wire to connect the 2 sets of white wires)and install the fans white wire into one of these sets of white wires. The ground should be connected to a green wire. Older home do not have a green wire so if you connect it to some part of the electrical box, it will be grounded at the box and through the conduit to your fuse boxes ground. I usually drill and tap a hole inside the bottom of the box and use that as a ground using a machine screw. There are so many wires in that box it might be a good idea to use electrical tape to securely insulate the wirenuts from vibrating off the wires and tapeing the bare ground wire to insulate it against any future vibration issues.<SEP>how do u id the correct wires from the home to a ceiling fan the fan is esy to id but the home wire are not? the fan has blue black white and raw the home wires are black blue (1 each) 4white/beige and tucked up in the box is red i know the black and blue go to the black but where's the raw(ground) and the white go to?<EOS>

You start at the beginning. A cracked head or head gasket can have various symptoms. While the engine is cool check the radiator water to see if any oil is present. If no then check your oil to see if any water is present (it will look milky). If no then start the engine with the radiator cap off. Look in the radiator to see if it blows bubbles. If no then check the exhaust to see if much water or oil is coming out or is present in the pipe (Some water is there naturally from condensation. If it doesn't smell like anti-freeze you're OK)If no then visually inspect around the head and valve cover to see if any anti-freeze is present.If the answer is no to all of the questions the head and gasket are more then likely intact. The only other test I would recommend would be a compression test, but if you have never done one you may want someone to show you how or go to a mechanic. If you answered yes to any of the questions you probably do have problems in that area, though some could be caused by  mechanical problems other then a blown head gasket or a cracked head.<SEP>How can you tell if your car has a cracked head gasket?

Mr. plevine, you first have to determine whether your system uses R-12 or R134a before servicing or troubleshooting it. How do you know whether the system in your vehicle uses R-12 or R-134a? LOOK FOR SPECIAL INDENRIFICATION DECALS OR LABELS ON THE MAJOR COMPONENTS.What else should you look for? The high-side low-side service fittings on an R-134a system are completely different from those used on an R-12 system.On an R-12 system, the high-side service fitting is a 3/8-inch 24 for screw-on couplers; the low-side fitting is a 7/16inch 20 (also known as 1/4-inch flare fitting) On an R-134a system, the high-side and low-seide service fittings are special 1/2-inch Acme-type fittings with no external threads. They have internal threads, but they're for the specially-designed caps unique to R134a fittings. Mr. plevine look for a RED-CAP for high-side BLUE-CAP for the low-side. Be mighty-careful when you service airconditioning system.GOOD LUCK!<SEP>How do i find my low pressure line on my  98 buick park ave a/c system?<EOS>

Be more specific. Disc or Drum brakes. Disc are easy, just take out the 2 bolts on the back side of the caliper and the top comes right off.

First check the pad to make sure that there are no visilbe leaks.If no visible leaks then fill the pool up to the maximum level. Then do what's called a static water check. Turn all the equipment off and wait a few days until the water seeks the level of the leak, in which case it will stop lowering. Then take a very close look around the perimeter of the pool water and look for the leak. If it is in the liner, then patch it. If it stops at a suction or return line take a close look for any crack or break, if so then use something like an A and B expoxy to repair it. You can get it at your friendly neighborhood pool store. If you think the leak could be in the pool plumbing (between the pool and the equipment) you need to purchase some expandable test plugs (you can get them at Home Depot and other fine hardware stores) and plug all the suction and return lines (including the main drain if you have one). Big bummer if you have to swim to the bottom in cold water. You may have to use a screwdriver to remove a plastic cover to expose the piping to get to certain areas. Make sure you measure the pipe before going to the store to purchase the plugs. Most piping is 1 12" pvc or 2" pvc. Once the plugs are installed, fill the pool again and wait a couple days. If the level stays the same, the leak is not in the pool liner, it is somewhere in the plumbing.  If the piping is underground then big bummer dude. If that's the case I would next talk to your freindly neighborhood pool repair person for the next step, which could be pressure testing, etc. It all depends on how easy or difficult it is to access your plumbing. Good luck.<SEP>how do you locate a hole in an above ground pool liner?<EOS>

You've left out a bit of information, such as inground or above, type of equipment etc. I'll post my generic closing guide here for you.Ideally, your closing starts a week before you actually get down to putting the cover on. Get your water balanced chemically first. That week allows you to do this.On closing day: Vac the pool and drain it to just below the pool returns. They are typically the lowest point in the system. When drained to that point, add in a winterizing chemical kit (most pool shops sell them), they typically contain an algaecide, shock and sequestering agent . Remove ladders and rails. You may remove the diving board if you wish, or cover it in opaque plastic sheet and secure it. If you totally remove it,  place something over the diving board jig bolts and lube those bolts or tape with duct tape that jut up through the deck. This can prevent stubbed toes and saves the jig bolts from corrosion.You're done at the pool for the moment. Head over to your pool equipment. If this is a sand filtered pool, you ought to have done a backwash, during the draining process, to clean out the filter. If a D.E. pool, then the same applies to clean off the elements. You can remove them later for a thorough cleaning. If a cartridge filter, just remove the cartridge and clean at your leisure.For all filter types, there will be a drain plug, remove it and keep it out.Over to the pump. All inground pumps will have 2 plugs, one midway back on one side and one directly in front.All above ground pumps have a single one, located at the front, under the impellor housing. Remove them and place them in the pump basket along with your filter drain plug. It's a nice , safe place, that you won't lose them in, as you'll leave the pump basket right where it is. This next part all depends on your pool plumbing, you'll have to decide the best route as they are all plumbed differently and the many different ways to blow out lines would be a book unto itself. You'll need to tap into both the return and the suction lines. Typically for the returns, you disconnect a line between your filter and heater (if equipped) and for the suction, you can go directly in from the front of the pump, without disconnecting anything. Doing it this way, will allow you to blow all the water out of the heater, pool returns, any waterfall or fountain(if equipped) or attached spa. Same goes for the suction line for skimmer, in wall suction for a pool cleaner and attached spa suctions (if equipped). You can rent a line blower from a rent all or your local pool shop, or you can use a medium sized shop vac that has a blow feature. The shop vac hose is actually the same diameter as the inside diameter of most pool plumbing (1 1/2 inch) so it makes a good fit. Blow out the lines, until you only see a tiny dribble at the pool, both suction and return. Charge the line with plumber's antifreeze (not automotive) and blow that through to the pool, for all lines. When you see the dye colour of the antifreeze at the pool, it means that the antifreeze protection is sufficient. Plug with your telflon taped winter plugs, all lines ending at the pool. Put something squishable (empty chemical containers or an old partially filled inner tube) into the skimmer to protect it from freeze damage. Remove the pressure guages from the filter and put them in the pump basket with your equipment plugs.There are 3 basic types of pool heater, electric, gas and solar. You don't mention which you have, so I'll assume if you do have one, it's gas. Open the drain cocks on both sides of the heater header (you blew out all the water , when doing the lines, should just be a little anti freeze that dribbles out) and disconnect the pressure switch from it's compression fitting. No need to store it, just let it hang from it's electrical wires. Turn off both the gas valve on the interior and the gas feed line going to the heater.

The simple ingredients of baking soda and vinegar can unclog drains. Best of all, you're fixing the problem without pouring anything toxic down the drain.   Steps:  1.   Remove contents from sink/tub.  2.   Pour 1/4 cup of baking soda down the drain.  3.   Pour in one cup of vinegar into the drain.  4.   Cover the drain with a lid and wait fifteen minutes. The baking soda and vinegar will have a chemical reaction, breaking down the clog.  5.   Rinse the drain with hot water to clear it out.  6.   Repeat if necessary.        Tips:   You may need to use a plunger to help break the clog. I have also heard about adding table salt to the concoction.

I assume you have an electric water heater. If so I suspect one of the elements is burned out or one of the thermostats is bad. Electric water heaters have two thermostats and two heating elements. If one of the elements burns out or one of the thermostats quits working you don't get enough hot water.But first connect a hose to the outlet at the bottom of the tank and run water out of it for 10 minutes. See if clearing the sediment helps. Sometimes sediment keeps the bottom element from working right. If it doesn't help then it is either a thermostat or heating element in which case you should call a service man and have it repaired.<SEP>How to make the hot water last longer?

clamp down on the bolt head if you can, if not, grab the back side of the shaft w/ vise grips and force it off.

Strobe Lights can be purchased at many auto parts locations.  They are however, illegal to operate while the vehicle is in motion.  Impersonating an emergency vehicle.  To install one, you need to put it someplace where it won't get wet.  Most of them that I have seen, would simply drill a small hole on the inside of an existing turn signal housing.  Make it the same size or slightly larger than the strobe light itself.  Then you just put the strobe in the hole and seal with silicone to prevent water leakage.  Then wire it to a switch to turn on.  Basically it's as easy as installing a new light.  Like I said though, don't get caught using it on the road.<SEP>How do i install strobe lights on a car?<EOS>

The type of tile can make a difference in the way you tile. However, with all tile.  You need to make sure your surface is level.  If not there is a product you can get at Home Depot to fix it.  Once is dries, sand it down so that everything is level.  Then you're set to mortar you tiles in.  Follow that direction on the bag.  Rent a wet-saw to cut large tiles.  After you get your tiles set, you'll need to wait a least a day before grouting.  ONce again, follow the directions on the bag.  Make sure yo get all the tools yo need ahead of time so you don't wast time driving back and forth to the store.  Home Depot sells an all in one bucket that will have everything.

You need to what we call backflush or reverse the flow of the coolant in the system. as the engine gets hotter ther thermostat located usually near the top of the engine will open and allow coolant to flow to the radiator where it then falls through the channels and the mving air passing through the radiator cools it, so your coolant flows in this direction to remove impurities you have to reverse the flow.  Remove the thermostat and then force water the opposite way round the system including the radiator, you can add a flushing compound but the most important thing is to continue witth this until you get clear water, when finished refit the thermostat and new gasket/seal if it has one and then add the correct amount of antifreeze and top off with water til it reaches the level required, run vehicle with the heater on hot until normal operating temp is reached and then very very carefully using a rag gently remove the pressure cap to check the level, if it is low use warm water to top it up as this will avoid a coolant shock to any of the alloy components and gaskets in the engine.

First of all you will need a torques bit for the drain plug.  Then if you are lucky enough to have a spin on filter you just loosen the filter and put oil on gasket of new one.  remove the old filter spin new one on and tighten 1/4 to 1/2 turn.  And put plug back in and put 6 quarts of new oil in it.  But I have a feeling that since you are asking this question you probably have the canister style filter.  This can be easy or a night mare depending on how tight the filter housing was put on last time.  There is a 3/8 ratchet insert on the end of the oil filter housing but if at all possible I would use a wrench on the big nut instead because the ratchet is in the middle and the housing is aluminum and can be brittle.  Either way you loosen the cap on the filter housing and unscrew it until it comes of then the filter will be inside.  Be care full that the housing doesn't turn.  If overtightened last time the chance of the housing and not just the cap coming loose is imminent.  If the housing comes loose you are screwed especially if your are laying under your car to do it.  If you are lucky enough to get the cap off and not loosen the housing then  just take old filter out and push new one in.  Replace cap and then just like the spin on filter both engines take 6 quarts of oil.<SEP>How do I change the oil on a 97 Cadillac Catera?<EOS>

If I'm reading your question right, there may be a pretty easy remedy. To correct the hitting near the top of the jamb, remove a hinge screw (closest to the interior of the house) and drive a 3 or 3 1/2 inch screw through the jamb and into the framing beyond. Usually tightening the screw will pull that hinge away from the opposite jamb and correct the scrubbing. However, when you pull the hinge there is a tendency to lift the other side of the door, so watch the margin between the top of the door and the top jamb so you don't create another scrubbing problem there.    The gap at the bottom is not as easy. To correct this you'll need to remove the casing from the hinge side of the door. If you cut the caulking where the casing meets the wall before you pry on it, you'll minimize the damage to the wall finish.  After the casing is off, place a pry bar, screwdriver, or whatever behind the  bottom hinge (between the jamb and framing) and push the hinge toward the other side of the jamb. Watch the gap and see if this helps. If so, drive a wedge behind the hinge and secure it with a small nail. Again, pay attention to the margin at the top of the door to make sure it's not binding. If everything looks OK, cut the excess off the wedge and reinstall the casing. Hope this helps<SEP>How can I straighten my front door?

If the problem is the bolt does not line up properly with the stike you can adjust the stike plate. This is sometimes caused by normal settling of the structure. There are several things you can check if this is an existing lock. First check and see if all your hinges are screwed in tight, if the hinge screws have loosened over a period of time this will cause the door to sag slightly and cause a misalignment. Second make sure the screws is the lockset are properly tightened. In the case of typical entry knobs and dead bolts it is best to tighten the latch bolts first and than the screws through the lockset.If every thing else seems up to snuff you can place a small amount of paint on the bolt while the bolt is retracted.

Depends on what car you are talking about. Every computer controlled car has a different voltage input for the oxygen sensor. The sensor sends a voltage signal and tells the computer if the engine timing needs to be adjusted or not. The eliminator sets this to one constant voltage that tells the computer to advance the timing and leave it there. Thus giving your car better performance and acceleration. But you will need to find what that voltage is at WOT for your car.

Check tread depth on the running surface, as others suggested. In my opinion, having at least 4 mm tread is reasonable!

The broken bead will leak like others have said but should only cause a pull if it is low on air. Now another pull is alignment related. The last type of pull is from the physical make-up of the tire. The easiest way to eliminate if it is a tire pull is to have the car taken to a shop and have the front tires only rotated side to side. If the pull follows the tire from the right front you know that the problem is not an alignment issue but a tire issue. From here you have a few options, You could either have the tires rotated front to rear and the tire with the pull won't cause any more problems being on the rear, or you can replace that one tire.<SEP>How can you tell if a car tire has a broken bead?

You said vinyl floor right, well don't use thinner, it will breakdown the vinyl and make it rubbery. Hopefully you still have a glossy shine to your floor, that makes it so the paint cannot bond with the floor very well. Wet the area with water, then using a spray bottle, mist the paint with rubbing alcohol (80% or greater). It will react with the paint but not the floor causing a chemical reaction with the latex in the paint, making the latex rubberize.

The best way to do this from my experience is to tie a function to a button/image. The only drawback is that you cannot pass parameters along with a script assigned to a button. Due to this you will need to make a function specific to each navigation but they can call be a in a single script file.  Steps:  Create an image (Insert -> image) and style it to your preference  Create a custom function with the following:  function showSheetByName(Name) {    var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();    var sheet = ss.getSheetByName(Name);    SpreadsheetApp.setActiveSheet(sheet); }  and then a function specific to your button  function showSheet5() {    showSheetByName("Sheet5"); }  Finally assign this function to your button  Assign Script... showSheet5  You should now be able to click on your button and navigate to "Sheet5". This can also be modified to go to a specific area of the sheet as well.<SEP>Link to specific sheet in Google spreadsheet<EOS>

first thing is go to auto zone and get about 7 quarts of tranny oil and get a new filter and gasket,then jack up the front end and then its a good idea to let it cool down first,thentake out the bolts and let it drain into a pan and after it gets all drained out,take the rest of the bolts out and drop the pan and clean off all old sealer on the pan and the tranny,now pull down the old filter and put a new o-ring on the new filter and put it in where the old filter came out of,now put the new gasket on the pan (if you want to,you can put some sealer on both sides or the gasket)and install the pan and gasket and put the bolts back in(just snug them up,dont overtighten them or you could warp the pan).now let the car back down and put in,ill say about 4 quarts of oil and start the car(let it idle)go through all the gears and then back in park,let it run and fill it until its just about a half pint low,then take it for a drive and come back and check the oil,if it needs some fill it to the full mark.i hope this helps you out.<SEP>How do you change the transmission filter on a 98 Ford Contour?

The snake and camera are for sewer pipes.  To locate a pressure water leak you need A subsurface listening device such as geophones or fischer locators.  These are like stethoscopes only louder.  I hook up an air compressor to the water line via hosebib.  This makes the leak much louder.  It takes a lot of experience to locate a slab leak so I would suggest calling a slab leak specialist/plumber to locate it for you.  Sewer leaks you can find by performing a hydrostatic test and locate.  Also pretty tricky.  You use test balls to stop up the sewer and fill the drain with water.  If the water in the pipe drops you let the air out of the test ball and move it a couple of feet andtry again.  I would also recommend a plumber for this or it will take forever.  Experienced plumbers will know how to isolate the sewer pipes to make the job faster.  It takes me about two hours to do a full test and locate for drain leaks.  Around $275 to locate water leaks. $475 for sewer.  The smart plumbers will charge by the hour on sewer because it can take all day depending on how many leaks and access.<SEP>How can I locate a broken water pipe under a concrete foundation?

despite what people think. alot of companies now do make custom parts for home brew turbo kits. obviously tuning companies will have reasearched the situation much more than me or you would be able too. But a generic build would require dropping of the compression ratio (low comp pistons) and a low pressure turbo would be your best bet (something like a standard unit from say a nissan 200SX S13 series - Garret T25). you will need an intercooler too just for piece of mind. The biggest issue on the whole idea would be the management and the fueling. Your best bet on that would be a honda modding site as there are plenty of people who have taken that route with the B16 and B18 engines and reached power in the region of 300+. if anyone can help you out it would be them.The biggest money eater in any conversion is the installation labour as a tuner/garage will charge a small fortune to get the parts in the car, if your competant or have people who are and can help you could build up the block out of the car yourself, fit it and then get it set up and mapped on the rollers and most defo save money.<SEP>How can u build an inexpensive turbo kit?

Tools:portable workbenchwoodworking clampcarpenter’s pencilchiselcombination squarescrewdriverstongue depressormixing spatulahammerfilepull sawsandpaperutility knifedrill and paddle bitsawing jigrubber gloveswax papersafety glassesdoorknobdowel rodepoxywood filler  Steps:1. Disassemble the door’s handle and lock by first removing the screws on the side of the handle and sliding out the mechanism.2. Reattach the damaged veneer and cracked areas of door by mixing up epoxy and filling the cracks using a tongue depressor.3. Place a piece of wax paper over the area and secure the damaged door with a woodworking clamp while the epoxy hardens.4. Since the original opening for the lock mechanism was incorrectly cut, you'll need to use a section of dowel to fill the opening so you can start over.5. Pick a dowel of the appropriate diameter and cut about a 4-inch section. Score grooves along the length of the dowel piece to give the epoxy something to bond to. A good way to do this is by clamping a handsaw upright on a workbench and carefully dragging the dowel across the teeth of the saw.  6. Mix wood epoxy and spread along half of the dowel. Insert dowel into lock hole. Apply the woodworking clamp again while epoxy hardens, about 30 minutes.7. Cut away any excess dowel with a pull saw. Cut as close as possible to door without damaging it. Fill all remaining depressions with adhesive filler.8. Smooth down the area with a rasp followed by sandpaper.9. Drill new hole through dowel for lock using a paddle bit. Orient the doorknob and mark the edge of the mortise while holding the lock plate in position on the door edge.10. Score out the cut for the mortise using a utility knife. Make sure to stay inside the lines you drew.11. Chisel out a mortise, about 1/8-inch deep, using a chisel and hammer.12. Pre-drill holes for mounting lock plate and attach with screws. Reassemble doorknob mechanism and re-hang door.<SEP>How do I fix a stuck doorknob? My front door will not open.

Sorry to say but both previous answers DO NOT give the correct procedure for ignition switch replacement.

There should be a a "spring loaded" tension pulley on it somewhere. Follow the path of the belt until you find it.

Just because the car's lights work doesn't necessarily mean the battery is fine.Does the car turn over? A starter motor (electrical) actually turns your engine when you are trying to start your car. If when you put the key in and try to start the car and you hear no sound at all, or maybe a click and then no sound, it would either be your starter motor has died and it needs to be replaced, or your battery can't give enough amps to the starter motor to start up the car.I would recommend doing this in this order.1. Check the fluid level in the battery. If the fluid is low in the battery fill with distilled water up to the necessary levels.2. Have someone try to jump start your car with a pair of jumper cables. Let the good engine run for a minute to try to place a charge in your battery. If your car starts up, then the battery is what was dying, or you were low on electrolyte (what the water you added to the battery becomes). Drive the car for about 10 minutes to charge up the battery. Don't use any accessories if possible (ie turn off radio/head lights and anything electrical). If you turn off your car and it starts back up, your done.If trying to jump start the car and it doesn't turn over or all you hear is a ping or click sound, then your starter motor is most likely the problem.

If the hole is really big, cut the sheetrock so that the hole is rectangular. Cut, from a new piece of sheet rock you got from your favorite home improvement center, a "patch" that is approximately 1" bigger than the hole on all four sides. Use construction adhesive to glue the patch from the backside into the hole. You may need to hold this patch in place with sheetrock screws around the edges. When that's dry (give it some time!) cut another piece that just fits the hole, about an 1/8" smaller on all sides. Glue that over the backing you put in. Let that dry. Use sheetrock tape and mud to finish off the seams. Sand, texture and paint to match. This isn't a difficult project. You need a sharp knife, straight edge, some sheetrock, sheetrock mud, sheetrock tape, construction adhesive, sheetrock screws, screw driver, canned texture, sand paper, paint and a 4" - 6" putty knife. Let everything dry before moving on to the next step.<SEP>how do i repair a large hole in drywall?  what tools should i use?<EOS>

Even most shop manuals do not cover removing body components such as this. If you want factory information for it you can go to www.motorcraft.com and access the factory manuals for 19.95 for 3 days. Most lamps are secured by either a screw through the lens to the bummper or by vertical screws behind the bumper into the lamp housing. You can raise the car and remove the lower cover panels and reach the lamps from the bottom. If you are still not able to access the lamp screws the bumper is really not hard to remove. There are several pop in clips along the upper and lower edges and at the wheel housing plastic covers then usually 2 bolts that hold the bumper up to the fender on each side.

The tires themselves will fit on the rims of your new car. Without knowing what car they came off of, and what the new car is, I can not tell you if the rims will fit, or not. Try to put one of the tires on, and see if the bolt pattern is the same and the wheels fit. If they do, you are good to go! If not you will either have to have the snow tires mounted and balanced on the new car's rims, or you will need to get spare rims to mount the snow tires on.Going one size down is not going to be a big problem, your speedometer and odometer will be a bit off.

Purchase the correct breaker for the one you are replacing.To be safe, you will need to shut off the main breaker and all the other breakers.  Take the cover off the panel.  Find the breaker you are replacing and unfasten the wire from it (usually a flat screw terminal).  Remove the bad breaker and install the new one in its place.  Reattach the wire to the new breaker.  Install the panel cover.  Starting with the main breaker, turn the main on and then one by one, turn the rest of the breakers on.  It is necessary to do them one at a time to prevent a surge of current that may trip the breakers or the main.<SEP>How do change a circuit breaker switch in my home. one of my switches actually broke? just need to change swch<EOS>

I have figured out a way to get them out via forwarding them, using a browser scripting tool call iMacros.  I think this macro will only work with Firefox 3.6 which you can get from this link .  I wont go into installing and setting either of them up, but here is the macro I used.  VERSION BUILD=7300701 RECORDER=FX TAB T=1 FRAME F=4 TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:hE&&TXT:Reply WAIT SECONDS=.5 TAG POS=1 TYPE=TEXTAREA FORM=NAME:NoFormName ATTR=NAME:to CONTENT=test@GMAIL.COM TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TABINDEX:1&&ROLE:button&&TXT:Send WAIT SECONDS=3 TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG ATTR=ALT:&&SRC:images/cleardot.gif&&CLASS:iHkD0e&&TXT: WAIT SECONDS=2  Just replace 'test@gmail.com' with the email address you want to forward to.  Now the only other key piece of advice is where to start the loop of the macro.  To do it right, you will want to create a label and assign all your gmail chats to it.  This will allow you to see your chats in chronological order and forward them that way.  Then in gmail click on the label, when the list opens it will likely open to the newest first.  Therefore, go the the last page of the labels contents.  Open the last item.  here is when you click "play loop" in iMacros.  I had 1k chats to export.  You'll notice there are "wait" statements in the code, this will give the browser time to keep up. They may need tweaking.  Also, check back every couple of minutes, because it sometimes throws an error, or tries to move to the next (newer) chat before the email has been sent.  Just click "cancel" and it will go back to the script and the email will have been sent.  If it throws any other errors during operation, you should be able to adjust the loop duration and start it again with no problems.  This has been aggravating me for so long since I switched Gmail accounts due to spam, so I am finally happy to close that account having got all my content out.<SEP>How can I export my Google chat logs?<EOS>
Use a damp cloth before the stain. This is called "popping the grain" as it allows the stain to penetrate better, because the wood, like a sponge will be more apt to absorb it.

You must first remove the old one.  Start by getting a drain pan.  Put it under the drain plug of the radiator and open it.  It should be a valve at the bottom that will turn with minimal pressure from a pair of pliers. Open the radiator cap to allow breathing while draining. Once drained, then you will need to remove the hoses.  Should be two, an upper and lower.  I would do the lower first.  After the hoses, you'll need to undo the two transmission lines assuming you have an automatic transmission. If it's a stick shift this part isn't necessary.  You'll likely want to "stop up" the ends of those lines so tranny fluid doesn't leak all over.  Eyeball your new equipment beforehand to make sure all these inlet and outlet connections are going to be the same on the old one and new one.  The overflow line from the cap area to a separate bottle will also have to be disconnected.  Next would be to locate whatever brackets and bolts that need to be removed to extricate the old radiator.                                   There should be a fan shroud or a fan assembly with shroud that you will have to figure how best to remove. depending on how your car is made, it may be easier to remove the whole fan assembly after you remove it and the radiator as one unit. When I did mine, there was one electrical connection to the fan assembly that was actually attached to the radiator itself.  I disconnected the electrical plug and removed the assembly after removing the radiator.  Much easier to get to that way.  Then you begin doing everything in reverse order to install the new one.  make sure you refill the new one with the appropriate mix of coolant and water.  Half and half is pretty common but you may want to consult your manual.<SEP>how do i put in a radiator?<EOS>

You can use the chisel and hammer method, or even a rotary hammer to do it but if you do this you risk damaging the concrete blocks.  My advice would be to rent a Concrete Saw (the back end looks like a chainsaw and it will have a 10-14" diamond blade on the front end).  Cut the grout line down the middle and try to avoid angling the blade.  To help you cut a straight line you can get a 4 1/2" grinder and a diamond blade for it (the diamond blades can be expensive i'll warn you) and use it to score the grout) if worse comes to worse you can get a 7" diamond blade and throw it on a skilsaw and use it set to a very, very shallow depth to cut your score line.This is a physically harder way of doing it but you'll have a much lower risk of busting blocks which if you used a rotary drill and chisel you almost certainly would.  I also doubt it takes much to cut through the grout.<SEP>How do I take appert cement blocks that have been cemented together?<EOS>

Try locating the drawings for your home.  We (Florida) are required to keep residential plans on file for 15 years.  Hopefully, your truss engineering would be included in those plans.You can very easily get an opinion from a licensed architect or engineer with your truss engineering.If it was conventionally framed (i.e. 2x6 or 2x8's) then you need the span distance, your first floor construction criteria and your footer design.  Not to knock calling a contractor, but I would run the information by a licensed architect or engineer.  They would have to provide you sealed drawings for your permit anyway. (Sorry, maybe not where you live but in Florida for sure.)I would not do anything with the space if you are unsure.  If the space was not designed for attic storage, nevermind a habitable living space - the end result, such as a collapse may not even be covered by your home owners insurance if you don't do it properly.Maybe contact your local building official, perhaps they would answer a question or two.Best of luck!<SEP>How do you know if an attic is strong enough to be a living space?

Check the hose, wand and cleaning tools for obstructions. Debris often collects where one part plugs into another, or where the hose connects to the main vacuum housing. Remove the parts one at a time and remove any debris you find.  Clear any hidden obstructions by pushing a broom handle through the hose and wands.  Reassemble all the parts.  You may also have to replace the drive belt.1. Unplug the machine and flip it over so you can access the agitator brush.  2. Unscrew the bottom plate that holds the brush in place, using a screwdriver.    3. Lift out the brush by pulling the roller ends out of the slots in the vacuum base. If the drive belt isn't completely broken, one end will be wrapped around the agitator brush, the other around the motor drive shaft. Slide the belt off of each part. Take it to a hardware store to get a replacement.    4. Inspect the agitator brush before installing the new belt. Sometimes thread or hair will wrap around the ends or elsewhere on the brush roller. This can prevent the agitator from turning and cause a belt to fail prematurely. Cut any thread or hair with a sharp knife and pull it off.    5. Install the new belt. Slide one end over the agitator brush and the other over the drive shaft. Then reinstall the agitator brush. You may have to pull on the agitator brush to stretch the new belt a bit so the roller ends fit into the vacuum base.    6. Reinstall the bottom plate.<SEP>How to fix a vacuum cleaner?

Mix some powdered sugar with Twenty Mule Team Borax, about fifty fifty.  The borax kills the roaches.  They ingest it while going agter the sugar.

If you have a basement, put it on the sills and floor studs, and put all along the edges of the attic, if you have one.  Repeat as needed.  Roaches tend to infest neighboring houses and trees, so you will probably have to retreat the house regularly.  Another thing you can put down is diatomaceous earth, or silica.

you dont need top dead center to replace a distrib, unless yo think it was improperly installed. if there are no marks on the crank then unsrew #1 plug hold your finger over the hole Bump motor untill compression blows your finger off, try not to go past it. now if all you are doing is changing the distirb pull offf the cap, note the direction of the rotory button ( make a Mark somewhere reminding you) . make a mark on the pedistal where the bolt holds it into the motor. remove the bolt . oh yeah un plug the distrib. gently lift up on the distrib note the directon the rotory moves as you lift, its gonna move a notch or two from your mark. when you replace it transfer marks as best as you can from one distrib to the other, move th rotory to the positon the other came out at. slide the distrib in the hole one it lines up to the gears and drops in all the marks sholud be very close, whithin a 1/8 of and inch if not you didnt allow enough fro the gear to line up properly, lift up move the rotory over to compensate place in repete untill correct. hope this helps<SEP>how do you find top dead center on 4.3 liter v6 s10? need to know best way to find top dead center if taking distributer out<EOS>

slave cylinder is a hydraulics term- in connection with automotive applications it is the cylinder that actuates the brake shoes in a Bendix type brake, or the caliper in a disc system- the way you phrased this question makes me wonder if perhaps you have a less than honest mechanic. I have been working on various types of mechanical systems for years, and the term is almost never used in automotive applications- if in bendix brakes it's called the brake cylinder and in disc types it's called a caliper- maybe you should seek a second opinion from a different shop. even if they are honest, you might get a better offer on costs.<SEP>How do you know when your slave cylinder has gone out on your automobile?<EOS>
The ECU is located on the front floor, about under the passenger's toes. Pull the carpet down; a large protective cover will be seen over the ECU. On the upper edge of the cover is a window or opening, allowing the Light Emitting Diode (LED) to be viewed. Turn the ignition ON, but do not start the engine. The LED should begin to flash. NOTE: In the event that a code is encountered which is not on the chart, re-count the number of flashes. If the code is truly wrong, it will be necessary to swap the ECU for a known-good unit and recheck. Since this can be expensive, you may wish to bring the car to a reputable repair facility if no other cause of the failure can be found. This may save you the expense of purchasing an unnecessary part. Once the codes are read, refer to the appropriate troubleshooting chart for testing procedures. Note that some tests will require the Honda test harness. (Use harness No. 07HAZ-PJ7010A and 07HAZ–PH7000A for 1988–89 and 07LAJ–PT30100 for 1990).

I'm not sure exactly what you mean but if you're talking about the rain water coming off your house, one way is to bury black drain tile underground and extend it several feet away from the house.  You can also connect some of the drain tile with a wye connector.  Drain tile is the black drain hose that is sold at major home supply stores.  If your yard is sloped, you can bury the drain tile so it drains away from the house in the low lying areas.  This is especially effective if you have downspouts that drain across a sidewalk.  You can bury the drain tile under the side walk and connect it directly to the vertical downspout.  One of the most effective ways to dig under a sidewalk is to use a garden hose and water pressure. They sell fittings that connect gutter to drain tile.  Drain tile is also relatively inexpensive.<SEP>How can you move rainwater underground away from the house?<EOS>

If I understand the question, you want to know what the problem may be when the problem IS NOT that the system is undercharged? If the system is fully charged is your compressor cycling? If not, do you have power to the compressor? The system may have enough charge but if the pressures on the high side and the low side are not right the system will not operate properly. If the high side pressure is too high there is probably a restriction and a high pressure switch will shut the compressor off to prevent more pressure from building up. How do you know it doesn't need to be charged? If a shop looked at it they probably checked the pressure (or they should have) so find out what they were.

Long-term solution:1. Caulk the outside window frame, where it meets the house. Caulk all joints and seams in the outside of the window.2. Check the glazing compound inside and out to be sure it is attached to both the glass and frame.3. Caulk the inside joint around the window where it meets the wall. 4. Seal any cracks or seams in the non-moving parts of the window and sashes. 5. Use a weatherseal (I like V-Seal) to line the sides and bottom of the moving sashe, and the joint between the two sashes.That gives you a weather-tight window that will last a long time (depending at least in part on the quality of the caulks and materials), AND saves money in the summer as well.Additional insulation can be provided by outside mounted plastic sheeting, inside mounted shrink film plastic, good curtains, etc.<SEP>how to stop cold air from coming from windows that wasn't properly sealed to keep out air?<EOS>

If the engine takes too long to heat up then it probably is a bad thermostat. Watch the temp Gage and see if the temperature is in the proper range when the temperature gets up to the proper operating temp then the thermostat will open up letting the water circulate through the engine.You can tell when this happens as you may be able to hear the thermostat click and followed by a sudden and temporary drop in temperature as the cooler water from the radiator starts going through the engine and the warmer water from the engine goes to the radiator to be cooled by the fan also you may sense a sudden and temporary drop in engine speed when the fan kicks in .<SEP>How do I know when to change the thermostat or know when it isn't working?? I flushed my radiator about three times until water was clear and then refilled with half and half, coolant/distilled water. I did this because it hadn't been done since I bought the truck ('95 Ford Ranger, 107K miles) from a neighbor two years before, plus the fact that the truck's coolant temp gauge needle was going past the middle mark but not all the way into "H." Afterwards, it was a little better, but it still happened once in a while for long trips on the highway. Just changed the air filter w/ a K&N filter and strangely things seemed to improve, but the needle still moves a little past the middle. I don't know what else to do. So, I'm wondering about the thermostat...<EOS>

There's no gap, if it uses hydraulic lifters.  Adjust with the engine running for zero lash.  You'll have to put caps on the rocker arms before starting the engine , or you'll have oil squirting everywhere :-)Alternatively - with the engine off, and in the number 1 firing position, adjust the exhaust valves for cylinders number 1, 3, 4, and 8 and the intake valves for cylinders number 1, 2, 5, and 7.Turn the valve rocker arm nut counter clockwise until the valve lash is felt in the valve pushrod.Turn the valve rocker arm nut clockwise until all the valve lash is removed. Zero valve lash can be felt by moving the valve pushrod up and down between your thumb and forefinger until there is no more up and down movement of the valve push rod.When all the valve lash is removed, then turn the valve rocker arm nut clockwise 3/4 of a turn.Turn the crankshaft clockwise 1 revolution until the alignment mark on the crankshaft balancer is aligned with the notch in the engine front cover tab.With the engine in the number 6 firing position, adjust the exhaust valves for cylinders number 2, 5, 6, and 7 and the intake valves for cylinders number 3, 4, 6, and 8.Turn the valve rocker arm nut counter clockwise until the valve lash is felt in the valve pushrod.Turn the valve rocker arm nut clockwise until all the valve lash is removed. Zero valve lash can be felt by moving the valve pushrod up and down between your thumb and forefinger until there is no more up and down movement of the valve push rod.When all the valve lash is removed, then turn the valve rocker arm nut clockwise 3/4 of a turn.If the engine won't start due to no compression when you're finished, back off each nut about 1/4 turn and try again.<SEP>How do I adjust the rocker arms on a 350 Chevy?

Black smoke is carbon smoke, blue smoke is oil smoke. If you don't see any visible leaks, then it may be blowing it out while under a load or going down the rosd and not smoking when it is sitting still. Try either having someone follow you to see if it smokes or drive it a little hard and stop and get out and look right away to see if it is smoking. It could also be a valve cover leaking and it dripping on the exast manifold and burning it off instead of dripping on the ground and that may be why you are not seeing any leaks on the ground.<SEP>How can you tell where your car is losing oil when there is no black smoke coming out of exhaust & no leaks?<EOS>

what year is the car? If its newer (from 1996 up) it has r34 refrigerant, but if its older than that it has R12 and there's nothing you can do but take it to an AC professional. If its R34, then go to Walmart and purchase an adapter and your freon with an oil charge included in the freon. (Walmart has the cheapest freon as well as the cheapest adapters.) It might also serve you to put in a can of stop leak depending upon how bad your leak is. If you notice an oily residue on any of the hoses or on any sections of your system, then it demonstrates a leak and you should have that particular part replaced prior to recharging the unit because it will just leak out again.<SEP>how do you recharge a air conditioner unit on a car?<EOS>

Well those are some interesting answers.But anyways you need to have the unit checked by a tech-All (MOst) units will drip water. its just how the system runs. and there could be a few things wrong with yours. the defrost sensor could be bad. this would cause the unit to freeze up and not work correct. even in the winter if you have the heat on the unit will run the ac side and when it frost up it will defrost itself. and if the freon is low it could cause this.Im really shocked no one said the sensor though. I have fixed about 120units this winter and 50% plus have been the sensor and 40% freon 10% other small stuff (filter/breaker/electric panel/motor) At any rate you need to have someone come out and service the Unit. You cant do this yourself sorry to say. But with the Tech comeing out he can also go over the unit for you to avoid any other problems he spots.Goodluck<SEP>How do i stop a Central Air system from freezing up and dripping water?<EOS>

I am not a mechanic, but I did change an o2 sensor on a my 92 maxima once.  What you need is to call your local dealer's parts department and ask them for the directions to change the o2 sensor from their repair manual.  They will usually fax it over to you if you have the capability or make you copies.  Otherwise you can buy the repair manual and o2 sensor from them if need be or of course a auto parts store such as Autozone usually carries both items.

Three basic ways 1. Sanding.  Chemical paint remover. 3 Heat gun.  Sanding is the most labor intensive and it can become quit tedious if the wood is detailed. Start with an 80 or 100 grit and work your way up to a 400 depending on how fine you want the finish to be.  Chemical is the easiest but most hazardous to you and the environment.  just follow the directions on the stripper you select.  A heat gun is the trickiest to use.

My daughter put corn "silk" in the disposer, and it got really clogged up once! First you must turn off the electricity to the disposer, so you don't grind up your fingers or hand! The take the cover off the top and see what is in there and how full it is.  You can reach (it's yucky!) down in there and pull things out as much as possible. Try to get something (a large wooden spoon works great!) to put in and try to turn the blades (both ways) until you get them loose. Keep reaching in as you get it free to take out whatever is stopping the blades from turning. Keep working with the blades and taking stuff out (I have had to work at it for over 30 minutes for the worst one!) until you can turn the blades. Then reconnect the power and try to see if it will turn by itself.To prevent this from happening again, put a small amount of ice down the drain every once in a while or grind up lemon or thin orange peels to help clean the blades out (The lemons and oranges will make it smell better too!) Set a restriction of things that cannot go into the disposer, and post it next to the sink on a cabinet door. The next one who clogs it has to pay for the plummer, or do this diry job themselves!

All propane heaters create carbon monoxide as a biproduct of the combustion process.  Carbon monoxide is deadly and can kill you, by imparing the bloods ability to absorb oxygen.  There are many symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, including headaches and nausea.  If you are sleeping those symptoms could go mostly unnoticed and you simply won't wake up.  When you are awake you will notice the symptoms and realize (hopefully) that something is wrong.  Installation instructions for many of these appliances don't just prohibit bedrooms, but any area with a bed in it.Unvented Natural gas and propane heaters, have been banned in many areas of the U.S. and almost everywhere in Canada.  Where they are allowed, they are equipped with safety switches to shut them down, if Carbon Monoxide levels get too high.

95% of trapped odors are in your carpet, most likely from mildew. To get rid of the odor, you first have to get rid of its source. Go to your local auto supply store (auto zone, advance, O' Reilly, NAPA, etc) and buy some upholstery/carpet shampoo. Look for a kind that also disinfects if available. First vacuum the carpet. Then test the shampoo in a small inconspicuous area to make sure it is color safe. Work the shampoo in really well, blot it dry with a clean cloth, and then let it dry thoroughly. Then vacuum the carpet and upholstery again. you may need to do this a couple of times depending o the severity of the mildew so don't get frustrated. After you're done give the carpet a couple of squirts of your favorite cologne, or air freshener, for a finishing touch. Then you'll be good to go.

OK, take the middle pin out of the middle hinge. Now, you need a hammer. Lay each end of the pin on separate blocks. Now, hit the center of the pin very soft but hard enough to make it bend a little. not to much. OK. This will bend the pin a little. Now, put back the pin back from where you got it.

Mothballs placed around the outside of the house is suppost to repell them.Sodium lamps for porch and outdoor lighting is a great way to save on your energy bill and reduce the number of spiders that find their way into your home chasing the bugs that are attracted to normal "blue wave" lighting. Osage Hedgeballs, otherwise known as Hedgeapples or Sticky Balls (tee hee!) have been used as a natural spider repellent for a long time, but only in the last few years have they gained more mainstream popularity, even if there is no explanation for why they work. They can be found in the produce section of your local grocery store. If not, ask the manager to order them, they're very cheap and widely available.Remember, spiders like to eat other bugs. So, if you spray for other pests, you'll diminish the spiders' food supply and make your home a less inviting place to find a meal.<SEP>How can I keep spiders from coming into my apartment? I'm wondering how to repel spiders from coming through a door.

Removing the doors are the easy part, assuming this is worth doing at all--lift and remove.  It may be easier to just leave them installed in the frame and remove the whole assembly at once.The frame is a little trickier--unscrew and carefully break away from caulk.Removing the caulk is somewhat tricky--pull away by hand, use a plastic scraper, and/or try a caulk remover compound (that looks like caulk).  I wouldn't use a razor blade or any metal scraper as it could easily (and will likely) remove the paint or finish from the tub.<SEP>how do i remove a sliding glass shower/bathtub door?<EOS>
According to the website below:When your gas gauge reads empty, your tank is filled with air instead of fuel.  As you add fuel, the air must move out of the tank to make way for the gas.  Next time you fill your car at the gas station, take a look at the pump nozzle.  You will find a hole about a half inch from the end of the nozzle.  This hole is connected to a small pipe that travels through the nozzle to the handle.When you fill your gas tank, some of the displaced air flows through the hole in the nozzle into the pipe.  When the tank is full, the hole will be below the gasoline level and no air will pass through the pipe.  A mechanical switch inside the nozzle detects when the flow of air stops and shuts off the gas.You may have noticed that, after the pump shuts off, you can get more gas in your tank by pulling the nozzle out of the tank a bit.  This is because you’re moving the position of the hole relative to the gas level and allowing the mechanical switch to reopen.<SEP>How does the gas pump know when your tank is full?<EOS>

Jerry069 has a very good answer, it also depends on what you are trying to do.  If you are laying a lateral line on a septic tank the hole in the pipe should be turned to the bottom of the trench, with a slope of 1% that is 1" in 100ft.   If you are trying to lay a french drain to convey water from the footing around a building you can turn the holes on the side so water will enter in the pipe and you can convey it to a ditch or a gravel pit.<SEP>How to lay perforated drainage pipes?<EOS>
You need to wash the car thoroughly with soap and water,then wipe it down with a paint thinner to remove any wax or road tar, then sand with 400 grit wet/dry sand paper.rewash and wipe down,use a tac rag to make sure all dust is removed.

I suggest you use enamle paint (it will cover laquers and enamels) to use laquer you will need make sure you don't have enamel paint already on your car(laquer is much hotter and may make enamel bubble if painted over).Next mix your primer and shoot with smooth strokes,sand with 600 mix paint and shoot,top to bottom to avoid runs, if you do get runs sand with 600 then buff.<SEP>how to paint a car?<EOS>

I am actually almost certain it has to do with people who view your page because I was thinking about this and conducted a little experiment (it's kinda confusing but bear with me).  I started off by typing every letter of the alphabet and seeing who came up on the search. So for example, I typed "A" and saw who came up. I noticed that the list of people were not necessarily in alphabetical order, but the people at the top were certainly my closest friends whose pages I visit all the time.  Then I thought maybe Facebook sets the search bar up conveniently for you to find the people you visit the most. But then I saw something strange, the girl that I just added was actually the second person in the "L" list, the first being my best friend, so that seemed odd to me.  So then I started thinking that it might actually have to do with the people who visit your page. To test the theory, I went to my "C" list, where the top two people were actually pretty much equal in terms of how many times I've visited their page and I assume they've visited mine. I went to the second person in the "C" list and clicked on their page a lot, refreshed it a few good times. Then I went back and searched "C" and sure enough, it was now the second friend whose page I had been refreshing who showed up first . I knew that this second friend was camping and had no Facebook/no way of looking at my page.  Now here's the real kicker: I told my other friend in the "C" list, the one who used to be first when I searched "C" to go on my page a couple of times. She did. I then took a couple of minutes and searched "C" again, and guess who came up first?  That's right, the girl who had just searched my page, despite the fact that I had been looking up the other girl's page recently.  Does this really prove that the Facebook search bar operates on people who have viewed your profile? Maybe, but it could also prove that I have WAY too much time on my hands.<SEP>How does Facebook guess results when you search for someone?<EOS>

Purchase a short wire fish from Lowes or Home Depot (~$20).  Greenlee is a good brand.  Get a short one, 25' or smaller, for this application.  Drill small hole ( 1/2" diameter ) at top, where your speaker will go.  Do in a spot where there are no studs behind the hole.  Figure this out with a stud finder (~$10) or just knock on the drywall lightly and listen to the pitch difference as you move horizontally along the wall.  You want the hollow sounding knock to avoid contention with a stud.  DIRECTLY below this hole, drill another that will be slightly larger... maybe 3/4".   For bonus points, you might consider pulling back the baseboard molding so you can make your hole behind it (and thereby conceal the hold when replacing the molding).Roll out enough of the wire fish to span the distance between the holes (plus about a foot) and feed it into the upper one.  Curl the end of a thin metal coat hanger to fit into the lower hole and use it to grab the end of the wire fish.  Pull it out into the room.Tape your spreaker wire on good and pull through from above.  If you live in an older house with plaster walls, this is going to be more of a mess.  I wouldn't advise doing it.Doing this procedure on an exterior wall will work okay, but will require pushing the wire fish a little harder so it finds its way through insulation.  Your hole on the bottom may need to be a little bigger in order to successfully grab the wire fish.Good luck.<SEP>How do I snake wire through an existing wall?<EOS>

(6 10mm bolts)6- with the 21mm socket at the crank pulley give the engine two full turns and align all the timing marks (small arrows pointing downwards you'll find three markings, 2 in the valve cover above the cam gears, and one one the block above the crank) TIP: I like to give the engine the two full turns, verify that everything is fine and then give it an aprox. 1/4 turn more, until i feel there is no resistance in the cam gears, then mark with a chalk stick, makes it so much easier to put the new belt on.6- remove crank pulley8- loosen timing belt tensioner (14mm bolt, left pulley)that should cover everything, replacement is the inverse, should take you about 2 hours.<SEP>how do you replace a water pump in a 1996 kia sephia?<EOS>

Most baseboard Water heaters have small bleeders at the end of the heaters, some you can use a screwdriver, and some you need a small adjustable wrench.If you have more than one heater on that water line, "(this is called a zone)" You could have two,three, or four zones heating your house. This is done for efficiency and to reduce the problem of air in the system. You need to start at the heater at the end of that zone, and work back to the supply, {Hot water tank or boiler}. Be vary careful when doing this because the air, & water you bleed out can burn you.You might have to do this more than once to be successful.<SEP>how to bleed air from line in baseboard hot water system?<EOS>

Re-sticking may, or may not work well. As another poster said, the foam is the problem.

It's now a baked in feature under the GitHub Traffic section .   You can now see detailed analytics data for repositories that you're an owner of or that you can push to. Just load up the graphs page for your particular repository and you'll see a new link to the traffic page.   The old method used to be some hack like adding an image or similar web bug to your README file.  When someone comes across your repo, provided your README has an extension that GitHub will automatically render , then it should also load the image. And that should, depending on how the web bug is set up, give you some detail or clue as to the source of traffic.

How old is the House? IF, you have good pressure down stairs your water pipes may be Clogged going up, Galvanized pipes are bad about this with age. When you open them up you will see they Clogged with Crud and have a very small hole for the water.

Also, Remove the Shower head and see if there pressure from the pipe, it could be the Head and faucets are clogged if you have a hard water. It sounds like the pipes to me if they install the correct size to begin with. The larger your pipes the more pressure you get.

We went through the moisture problem and crawlspace vent issue years ago.  We found that there were conflicting opinions about vents, moisture barriers, sump pumps and proper ventilation. We were enlightened when we researched more.We found each home can have its own solutions but the moisture levels in the wood tell you much.  When moisture levels are over 20%, decay is inevitable but not rotting yet.  Moisture levels over 28% means the wood decay fungi is active (it feeds on the starch of your wood to rot it) and there is likely visible damage already.  Fungi and mold do not grow or become active if the levels are lower.  Generally, air flow keeps moisture levels down.Here is a Clemson University PDF home maintenance publication about moisture levels and control at :http://virtual.clemson.edu/groups/psapublishing/PAGES/FYD/HL255.pdf  Also NC State has one at http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/fcs/housing/pubs/fcs486.htmlThis is good too.

They open and close automatically with the temperature differences.  We were told by many that you close your vents manually.  Who wants to do that? It could be 30 degrees at night here, then 65 in the day during fall and spring.  Temp-Vents open and close automatically and don't even use electricity or batteries - and they really do look nice.

You will have to remove the heads from the engine. Then you will need to clean them as well as you can. I'm a mechanic and I have a straight edge that I paid $85 for so I could acuratly check heads to see if they are warped. I know it sounds crazy to spend that kind of money on a straight edge but the precision of the straight edge is better than just about anything else you are going to find. Then place the straight edge on the head and check the gap with a feeler gague about every six inches or so. There are specs. that are set by the manufacturer of what is aceptable.

Well, better to use a spirit level. Don;t have one? take a water pipe, around 6 or 8 mm dia. Fill the water. If youe machine has legs, take one as a master. mark a distance from ground say 100 mm for all the legs. keep the one end of the tube at the master leg" 100 mm mark. ensure water level inside tube is inline with the mark. Let some one to hold. Take the other end to other legs. Hold it along the mark, Now you can see whether this leg is Lower/Higher than master. I advise better buy a spirit level in market. It has mercury scale which will indicate the position immediateley.<SEP>How to Diagnose an Alignment Problem ?<EOS>

you did not state what is wrong with the axle.is the ring & pinion or differential shot?or is there something wrong with the hubs.contrary to what the dude before said, an axle from the 88-2001 GM trucks is going to cost a whole lot more then the previous year 14 bolt rear ends. the rear ends from a 73-87 body style truck are a dime a dozen and should only cost you $100-$200 at a junkyard.the 14 bolt axle had some design changes that started in 1988, and they arent as common as the old version (the old version came in the 3/4 and 1 ton trucks, the 1988 3/4 ton trucks used a semi floating axle as well as the full floating).  also since they arent as plentiful as the old design 14 bolt, they cost more, i would expect to pay in the area of $900+ to from a wrecker.depending on what bearings need to be replace, if its the differential bearings, you can get the entire kit for around $110-$150, and a gear set for $200, and then add $300-$400 for a shop to set them up.  luckily from the 14 bolts design, they are probaly the easiest axle to setup gears on so the shops dont charge as much as they would say a Dana series axle.they also charge less if you just bring them the housing out of the truck instead of the entire truck, its easier to replace everything while it is sitting on a bench instead of under the truck.<SEP>How to repair and replace a rearend of 97 Chev.

first you have 2 hoses to hookup- the water hose and the hose that came with your pressure washer- the water hose is simple to figure out- the pressure washer hose is easy too once you know how - most pressure washers have slide couplers on them - their usually brass and the either slide forward or back - u have male and female adapters and you insert accordingly - make sure your spray gun is hooked up also- turn your water on, make sure you have fuel in your machine.  If you look down beside your fuel tank you should see the choke, throttle, on/off swicth, and possibly a primer- if theres a primer there will be instructions as to how many times to push it - turn your on/off switch to the on position- choke your carberator, again there should be directions as to where the choke position is - but after that you are ready to go - pull the rope and when it starts take it out of the choke position- usually it'll crank but cut off b/c the choke is on but once you get it running all you have to do is decide on what tip u want to use- your spray gun will have a lock on it so you may want to apply it while you're inserting it in your gun --- something good to remember is that the wider the tip opening, the wider the spray field- wide spraying tips are used for applying or misting the object before you pressure wash it, be extremely careful with tips that have small openings b/c they can cause serious damage to whatever you are spraying- i recommend using your #2 or #3 tip  -- you'll develop a feel for the spray gun fairly easy and then you'll be able to decide how close or far back you need to stand from an object to be effective- also remember to wear safety glasses<SEP>How to operate a craftsman 2550 pressure washer?<EOS>

Cast_Chris, I'm not sure which type of door you have.  If the screen you have came with your door then you might have the type that has plastic inserts that run up the sides and across the top and bottom.  Look at the door from the inside, it may look as part of the trim but, you should be able to get a flat screwdriver in between the edge of the door's window frame and a tiny lip on the plastic strip.  Twist the screwdriver and it should start to pop loose, then you can pull the strip out.  Repeat on all sides.  Pull out the glass then replace it with the screen panel.  Then put back the strips, they should pop back into place with a little effort.  All this is of course if you have that type of door.  If not sorry for all the extra reading.  Hope this helps.

Remove as much of the nail polish as possible using a spoon or dull knife.Apply a non-oily nail polish remover to a clean white cloth and gently rub (in only one direction at a time) or blot the spot. Continue until spot is removed. Do not allow nail polish remover to get to the latex backing. Go to the next step to remove nail polish remover.Apply a small quantity of detergent solution to the spot. (To make the detergent solution mix 1/4 teaspoon of a hand dish washing detergent which does not contain lanolin or bleach with 1 quart of water; examples of safe detergents are Dawn® and Joy®.) Use a blotting motion to work the detergent into the affected area. If spot is being removed continue applying detergent and blotting with a white paper towel until spot is removed. Rinse with tap water using a spray bottle, blot to remove excess moisture.Spray lightly with water, do not blot this time; apply pad of paper towels and brick and allow to dry.If there is still some stain on the carpet and blotting is not removing it, then moisten the tufts in the stained area with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Let stand for on (1) hour. Blot and repeat until carpet is stain free. Light will cause peroxide to change back to water so no rinsing is necessary.

Well since you live in a Apartment building The only thing you can really do is Pull back the carpet And Mark the floor joist with a chalk lineThen use 2 1/2 deck locking screws every 6 inches or so This will pull the flooring down to the studs. also If any nails are sticking up hammer them in. This is the best way to fix this problem since you in a apartment. If you lived in a house and had a basement you could fix it from the bottom. since this is not the case this is all you can do. Call a carpet guy out to pull back the carpet off the tack strip (or do that yourself) do this to the floor and Call the Carpet guy back to kick the carpet back into place. Try to do this when the person you live above or below is not home it will make some noise. The carpet guy wont cost much.Also where you hear the noise start there with the screws after you put in 30 or so walk the floor untill the noise is gone. after the noise is gone put a screw in every 12 to 16 inches past the part where the noise stopped. this will make sure the noise did not travel and will slao stop it from moving down the hall or somewhere else..Happy screwing..LOLI had to write back to this ? and the 1 answer You dont want to cut the carpet If you do this the landlord can make you pay for new carpet. @nd make sure you find the joist if you do not find them and you drive a 3 inch screw into the floor and no joist you could hit a water line or elec.<SEP>How can  I stop the wood in my floor, under my carpet, from squeaking? Looking for a simple way to stop the noise.  Whenever I go to check if my daughter is sleeping, the floor squeaks, and she hears me coming.  I rent my apartment, so major repairs are out of the question.  A simple fix would be great if any of you know of one.Thanks,Ted<EOS>
