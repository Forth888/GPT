Home Depot or Lowe's has a Quickrete product called 'Commercial Grade Blacktop Repair' that you can use.www.quikrete.com/catalog/CommercialBlacktopRepair.htmlAll you need to do is clean out the repair area of foreign debris and repair the sub-base with pea gravel or other appropriate base material for your area (match the repair to the existing sub-base).  Get a tamper (a heavy, flat head with a handle) and compact down the sub-base.  Open the bag of repair material and pour enough into the area so that it forms a mound higher than the surrounding driveway surface.  Use the tamper again and compact down the fill repair material so that it is the same height as the rest of the driveway.

You probably don't. You will have to have a large wrench to fit the fan nut so you can remove it from the clutch. These can get stuck tight, and you will need a way to hold the pump pulley while you get that loose. I have a large adjustable wrench that fits (it's an 18"). Sometimes "popping" the end of the wrench with a hammer breaks it loose, some times you just gotta cuss at it!From there, its a matter of removing hoses, and pump bolts.

Not many options here. The key is you need to get the plunger out of the drain pipe. You can try a long pair of pliers or a hanger bent in to a small hook (about 1/2" would be about right). If you can't get it from the tub, you either have to go under or in from behind. If the tub is on the first floor and you have a basement or crawl space, you might be able to get in from there. Otherwise, it's pretty much in through the wall or the ceiling below.Good luck! Been there, done that. <SEP> How would you unclog my bathtub drain (not a sexy question, I know)? The bathtub is 50 years old, with a plunger-style tripwaste - i.e., you move the lever that's under the faucet, and it plugs up the drain without your seeing the plug.When you unscrew the cover over that lever, the tripwaste mechanism is supposed to come with.  Problem is, the thing is so old that the lever has corroded off and the mechanism/plunger are permanently clogging up the drain.  The tub drains, but very slowly.  I have tried pouring down boiling water, white vinegar, and drano.  Have tried pulling on the tripwaste with pliers.  Even tried using a toilet plunger, which actually helps the water flow slightly faster, but doesn't loosen the corroded mechanism.Plumbers say they'd have to tear apart the wall, for lots of $$$.  Isn't there any other way??  Help!!! <EOS>
Usually the cheapest and easiest way to boost horse power is to repace your air intake filter with a K&N air filter or some other "cold air intake system".

First try a good penetrating oil that you can get at a hardware or auto store.  Liquid Wrench is one brand.  WD-40 may work, but is more of a lubricating than a penetrating oil.  Apply and let stand for several hours or overnight.  If that doesn't work, put the screwdriver in the screw and tap lightly with a hammer, don't beat it too hard.  If the faucet has a metal handle, you can apply heat carefully.  You would have to use a torch.  If you don't have one, you can either buy one cheaply or possibly rent one.  Be careful with the flame!!

Depends on the mower, but there are two basic ways to do it.  Unplug the spark plug and check under the mower for a small plug going into the bottom of the engine.  That should be the oil drain plug & it normally has a square head.  If thats what you find, loosen the plug a bit, set the mower back down and lift it up on supports high enoght to put a drain pan underneath.  With the pan underneathe, take out the drain plug and the oil will flow into the pan.  After its stopped draining, replace the plug and tighten it snugly, but don't over tighten it.  Refill with new oil and your ready to go.On lawn tractors and some other mowers the plug is located in the engine block or at the end of a sort pipe above the mower deck or engine mount.  In his case, just get a pan in position to catch the oil remove the plug or pipe cap and follow the directions from above.Remember you want to do t=his with the oil warm, but not hot!!

Dry rubber sponges remove smoke well-without noxious fumes.Then a coat or three of paint will be necessary. 3000 square feet will take 4 people a week to complete. The paint will mask some of the odor. Try incense for the rest. As for the stone on the fireplace there is a product from saver systems that will take care of mild smoke residue, but it may need something more than that. If it does, you will need to vacate the residents for a day. Then you cover the area with heavy plastic sheeting, set up a fan system for fume elimination and break out the industrial strength masonry cleaner/acid available at your local hardware store. DO NOT attempt to fix your own fireplace! Do it yourselfers beware, this is not your realm. One chimney fire is enough, the second one may be YOUR last. There are liners and retrofits for this but improper installation can be more dangerous than leaving it unattended.

LTP Grimex or LTP Power Stripper or LTP Spot Stain Remover mixed with LTP Fullers Earth (depends if it's polished or unpolished marble).

Make two deposits; half the first trip and  the other half on the second trip.You could also place a dipper and a plastic bucket next to the throne. If your load was extra heavy, dip half out and put it in the bucket. Now flush. Deposit the bucket's contents into the bowl and flush again.Sort of like a NASA launch. To deal with a heavy load you must approach the problem in more than one stage.Another approach might be to purchase some teflon solution and apply it to the interior of the bowl just before release. Especially if your plop is particularly dry that day.I hesitate to recommend purchasing a pressure-assisted commode because a massive blockage in the downstream drainage pipe could result in a nasty blowback in the throneroom. If this should occur do NOT deal with it yourself. Call Merry Maids. They'll be able to deal with it much better than you, because you'll be in the hospital getting brown stuff and T.P. removed from your lungs.Good luck. <SEP> How do I keep my toilet from clogging when I crap in it? <EOS>

Had the same problem this spring. The bolts that you are probably referring to is in the powerhead unit. These are not your ordinary drill out type of bolts and then use an easy out like everyone here is recomending to you. Outboard motors are a unique repair due to the useage of them in SALT water with the corrosion in the head around the bolts. These cannot be removed by yourself. they must be taken to a machine shop to have them removed professionally. This is not an easy task or is it a cheap repair. These bolts alone are made for outbord motors and must be replaced with the same type of outboard replacement parts. The cost for labor and parts can run you several hunded dollars or maybe even over $1000. Best bet is to take it to a repair shop that does this every day, probably at a marina.  I dont know your model or size of this outboard but after you get this estimate , carefully decide weather the cost of the repair is worth the repair. Consider how many hours you have on this outboard. If your estimate runs into the thousand dollar or higher, and you have a lot of hours on the engine, then you may be more apt to buy a new outboard engine. I went this route about a month ago and decided that my $2200 estimate and 500 hours on my engine was not worth it. i bought a new outboard in another state and towed it home. I put my outboard for sale on E-Bay and sold it at a decent price to offset my new outboard price.Good Luck and think before you repair. <SEP> How do you remove broken bolts?

Hi, follow these instructions to the letter. If you are not too sure, take it to a garage.1/ Check the voltage across your battery with the ignition off.

There is nothing you can do.If anyone trys to tell you what is up without these basic measurements, they are wrong.Speak soon.Just for your info, doing this will tell you the battery 'no' load voltage, and the voltage that is running through the circuit at both idle and when driving.From this, you can tell if the system is charging.Once you have confirmed if it is or not, then it is time for a diagnosis.(Check the terminal clamps are tight and clean before doing this)As bobweb says DO NOT DISCONNECT THE BATTERY WHILE THE ENGINE IS RUNNING!!!! <SEP> how to increasing power generated by alternator? i own a 94 lincoln continental and i don't think the chargeing system is working to good i know when a cars started and you disconnect the battery the cars sopped to stay running but mine doesn't. got a new battery like 2 weeks old. is there any way to clean the alternator with out replaceing it with a new one because i know it runs the car with the battery and don't want to change it. <EOS>
You must buy a rear-brake rotating tool. (I'm not sure of the technical name) It screws the pistons in instead of pushing them in. Make sure the pistons screw in freely and make sure the e-brake mechanism is functioning properly. These calipers are notorious for seizing and having e-brake problems, in turn causing accelerated wear. My honest opinion, if you must ask how to do it, you probably shouldn't be doing the brakes on your car. The 2 most important things on a car are tires and brakes. If you screw it up, you could end up killing poeple. Please seek professional help if there is any doubt as to what you doing.

You can get the joiner at a hardware store, or use a threaded PVC connection that fits the size of the conduit.  This isn't necessary at all though, you can use silicon RTV just to water seal it and don't worry about attaching the conduit professionally.  It will serve the same purpose.

man, these kinds of intermittent problems can be so frustrating.  i like it better when things break and stay broken - at least you know if you do something and it works, the thing you did fixed the problem, and it didn't just fix itself.anyway is the motor sitting outside or somewhere that the temperature varies a lot from day to night?i used to work at a lab where a lot of equipment was in sheds where the air was just the same as the outside temperature.  sometimes these things would malfunction only at night or only during the daytime - it was because the circuitry was thermally cycled for a long time, and the variations in temperatures makes the circuit components expand and contract.  that repeated expansion and contraction can cause the solder joints and wires to weaken where they are under mechanical stress, and sometimes crack.these cracks can be very hard to track down, because they are so small and because the problem is intermittent.  so maybe you have the same problem where you leave it outside overnight and the circuit cools and contracts, opening up the connection - then it doesn't start until it warms up again and you get in there and wiggle it around.if i were you i would get in there with a multimeter and check to make sure that your connections are still good.  i suspect something is loose and when you take the cap out to check it, you wiggle whatever the loose thing is.  it could be a problem with one of the capacitor leads if messing with the cap fixed it.also, you may already know this, but a 440V 12mF capacitor can store quite a bit of energy - even if you unplug the motor when you work on it, the capacitor can still give you a very serious electric shock, particularly if you have wet hands or even damp skin, which you might if you are messing with a water pump.  so make sure to discharge the cap by making electrical contact between the two terminals with a bleeder resistor, before you touch anything, and let it discharge for a while.  a capacitor that size can be pretty dangerous.good luck! <SEP> How to troubleshoot the  1 hp jet pump ? Hi, I've been using a 1 hp jet pump(for the past 7 years)for lifting water from the shallow well to the overhead tank.I've been experiencing lot of problems due to the excessive hardness of the well water & my motor strucks many times.But this time it is not the problem due to hardness of water.My pump does not starts very often(for example, if I put this evening,it works but the next day it is not starting at all) .When I checked the capacitor(keltron 12.5 MFD 440VAC 50 Hz),it is ok & the coil is not burnt.This time I didn't want to spend more for the technician & removed the capacitor(myself) & checked & refixed it,to my surprise it worked for 3days & again the pump is not running(there is no jam in the impeller).Again I did the same thing as I did before but the pump is not running.My question is what will be the other reasons for the pump not running if capacitor is good & the coil is not burnt & there is no jam in the impeller) <EOS>

There is no known flexible chimney liner that I would recommend if you are burning wood, a chimney fire can reach 1700-2000 degrees. Only rigid ceramic or thick SS can stand up to that. However if you are venting something at a lower temp, you might use flexible SS tubing, it has rings, but take it from me, don't. And your homeowners insurance co won't like anything except ceramic or ul certified SS.

Using a dremel tool with a fiberglass cutting disk, carefully cut out the grout around the metal holder making sure not to damage the tile around it. Tap the metal holder with a hammer lightly, around edges and at the center, the holder should pop loose.

Hi KDiddy, the previous answers are correct on the cleaning and painting, and dewhittjames touched on ventilation.  Ventilation is the most important thing you can do in a bathroom.  Without ventilation even new fresh paint will mildew in a short time.  It'll be up to you on what type and where to put a vent fan, but to really help keep the mildew away, it has to be done.  Check the links below, the first is a Lowe's link that will show you how to install a vent.  The second is a link to a site that will give you an idea of what type of fans are out there and maybe what you can look forward to spending on one.  So keep this in the forefront of your project, you may want to do this before any painting ensues.  This would keep you from possibly damaging any finished product.

Make sure the power is on to the furnace or blower coil. That powers up the t-stat and makes the system work. An easy check is to flip the fan on/auto switch to on and see if the fan comes on. If it does, then the power is on to the furnace. Next try is to go outside and have someone flip the t-stat up and down. you should hear a clicking noise in the condenser outside.

A reconditioned engine will go through several steps and processes before it is reassembled. Depending on the type of shop doing the work, and the type of engine the rebuild process could be simple or complex. Most shops disassemble the engine, hot tank the main components like the cylinder block, head(s), and related. Next, all clearances are checked to ensure that they are within factory specification. Cylinders may be bored, but most of the time they only require being honed and ridge reamed.If the crankshaft is out of spec. it will be reground. Meaning the rod and main journals will be ground down to make concentric again. The crank and rod main bearings will be replaced with the corisponding under sizes. The pistons will most likely be reused, and fitted with new rings.camshaft(s) and lifters are inspected and reused or replaced. Oil pumps are replaced. All freeze plugs and gaskets are replaced. Water pumps are replaced, as are timing gears and chains or belts.Cylinder heads are checked, and all valves are removed and checked. The out of spec vavles will be reground or replaced. Valve guides are checked, and replaced if worn. Valve stem seals are replaced.Things like intake and exhaust manifolds, oil pan, valve covers, timing covers, front covers, etc. are cleaned and reused.Most reman shops will paint the completed assembly.There are other engine specific things I didn't mention, but this is a general primer on what is done to an engine.Of course this is on the shop level, backyard mechanics, and wannabe diy'ers will do it differently. <SEP> how does reconditioning an automobile engine work? what are the jargons and parameters associated with engine reconditioning involved <EOS>

I would agree with the answer calling your local B.B.B  keeping in mind that you get what you pay for.Dealing with pest especially the larger brands(i.e. Rats)can be and is a frustrating and miserable task.First of all be honest with yourself,can you handle taking on the vermin? are you equipped to handle the outcome using pest control agents such as poison,etc.? are you capable of disposing the dead rats after extermination? By using professions who are equipped to handle the above questions are usually followed up with further treatments of the infested areas.If you should decide to take on the task yourself your first task would be to find the Food and Water source of your particular pest.Bait or trap would be the solution to irradication,keep in mind the safety of any pets you may have or children that could access the treated area.I work a ranch and I have to deal with pest invading the feed bins for my horses.Elimination of the food source will be your first move..give a couple days to see if you had any further visits(droppings,fresh foot prints, etc.)If you have, then the proper bait (Poison)can and should be purchased at your local Feed store that caters directly with issues concerning Ranch and Farm Pest and can help you in your choice as to which brand to use.Most of the poisons used are strycnine(sp)based to prevent odor from dead pest.Also if you choose to go the poison route Please keep any pets that you might have (dogs,cats)its not uncommon for dogs to eat dead rats or mice...and before you use baits such as this Please also consider the Natural rat traps that hunt these vermin(owls,Hawks,Eagles)keep check on the areas baited,and look for obvious signs of area use by the pest and proceed accordingly by either application of more poison or the removal of it if your problem has subsided.I quit the poison end of my problem as it worked okay, but it didn't eliminate it...I finally decided to get a couple of cats ...trading 1 pest for another, because cats can and do become a problem also if not kept in check.Its not the cats fault, but the people who owned them and no longer want the responsibility of them, and simply take them for a ride to the country and drop them off..Cats are domestic animals and are not like there counterparts that survive by the hunt.If you live in city,Cats would probably be your best ally, have them 'fixed'and give them love and food, a warm place to sleep, and they will address the rats,Once rats get the message a new 'Sheriff' is in town they soon vacate.

The first answer is probably the best one, but you don't say where it is. If it's rising damp, ie coming up from the ground then you need damp proofing - probably best to do this by injection into the wall (see a builder). If it's being caused by something else and is therefore not coming up from the ground then you need to find out where from - is it cos your cavity is "leaking" somehow (see a builder) or maybe you have condensation caused by humid air condensing on the cold wall - normally external wall. If its from condensation then you can use a de-humidifier (to take the moisture out of the air) and turn up the heat to dry the moisture form the wall to the air. The you can turn the heat down again and use the de-humidifier either intermittently or constantly - whatever it takes. To reduce moisture in the air try opening window during and after bath,shower,cooking and dont dry clothes inside.

Occasionally a cactus will need to be pruned. It may have rotting stalks, or just seems to be getting unruly looking. The problem with pruning a cactus is that they scar easily, so any cuts should be made should angle inward and be out of sight. Another thing to keep in mind is that branches will not grow from where the cut was made and that a cactus grows very slowly. Cactus will generally only grow a few inches a year, but will live for many years. Prune cactus & succulents (if necessary) in the active growing season, let dry and callusing the wound surfaces allowing a good air flow and removing detaced branches.Here's a great site with directions, photos and tools:http://www.cactuspruner.com/Cacti are such great houseplants.

Spray one brand of the ant spray around the outside perimeter of your home, including garage, etc.  Heavier around areas that are damp, door thressholds, etc.  Repeat in about a week with the other brand.Take the other brand and spray afflicted areas indoors including baseboard areas near where ants have been spotted.  Repeat in about a week with the other brand.Put the Scotts stuff down on the lawn with a broadcast spreader.Ants are hardy and persistent creatures that are attracted to food and standing water.

Okay. Removing door panels isnt too different for any car. Make sure the window is down before you start. It will make it easier to get it off. There is probably a screw on th bottomside of the arm rest (or pull handle) What you use to pull the door shut.   Probably one in the trim around the handle to open the door. You'll want to get a door trim removal tool and pry the panel off starting in the corner. when you get an idea of where the clips are that are holding the panel to the door shell, start pryin in these spots along the bottom and up the sides of the door panel. When you get all thoses, lift the door panel UP. it is hooked to the door at the top by the window.when you get it off the shell, unplug the wires etc.. and VOILA! you should be done.

OK, don't use soda or any water-spraying methods - they will just spread the oil around and make it worse.  Oil floats on water, remember?

Even though the vehicle is under OBDII standards, switch the ignition off, then you can go to the plug in, located under the steering column (usually to the right), remove the cap if there is one, and use a paper-clip, bend the paper-clip into a "U" and insert it into the very first two openings, the top and the bottom on the first column. Then switch the ignition back on and watch your check engine light, it should flash "one" then "one, two, three" indicating 13 that it is being read, it will flash "13" 3 times. Then it will flash the code, "one, two, three" and "one, two, three" would inicate diagnostic trouble code "33." It will flash each code 3 times, and then move on to the next code. You'll have to watch the check engine light, and steady look at it, and count how many times is flashes to see what trouble code it is displaying. Then you can lookup "Diagnostic Trouble Codes" for your particular vehicle make/model on the internet.Or you can take it to Autozone, and they'll plug it in and check it for you, or any shop or dealership will be able to check it as well.The easiest, and best way to clear the trouble codes is to disconnect the battery cables, you can leave them off for maybe 5 minutes, and it will wipe out the memory. It will also erase the radio presets, which you can easily reset by selecting a station, and holding down the preset number. Most receivers will show memory or programmed or something showing you that the preset has been recorded. However, if the problem has not been rectified, then the light will reappear. So, you can use the paper-clip method or take it to someone who can plug it in, and read the code. It would probably be best to read the code before you clear it, even if it doesnt come back, just to know why it was there. <SEP> how do I reset the service&#92;check engine light on a 98 ford escort lx&#92;le? <EOS>

Portable generators are noisy. If you have neighbors nearby or the noise is unbearable in your house here are some ideas. - Choose an operating location as far away as possible. Note that a larger gauge wire is needed to reduce voltage drop as line length increases. Reducing line loss is required to minimize power loss and to ensure maximum power is available to the house. Lights will flicker less when heavy loads are attached. - Change the exhaust system. Noise from the portable generator systems comes primarily from two sources, the engine block and the exhaust system.. With an air cooled engine there is little you can do about block noise. Some engines can have a larger muffler attached or make other changes to the exhaust system. Merely mounting exhaust pipe vertically will noticeably reduce noise. - Build a noise shielding enclosure. This could be as simple as a piece of plywood to reflect sound away from the house to a separate shed to hold the generator. Design your enclosure with safety in mind. Provide adequate air circulation and ventilation to prevent heat buildup and to remove carbon monoxide. - If the noise bothers your neighbors, invite them over for coffee or offer to run line to their home to power the freezer or a few lights. Talk to them before starting the engine, ask they let you know if the noise is bothersome before they phone the police or harbor any resentment. A little diplomacy can go a long way. - Last resort, shut off the engine or buy a quiet generator. <SEP> How do iI make a loud generator more quit? <EOS>

I have always used Bullseye primer/sealer to paint paneling - especially dark paneling because it will cover in one coat. There are no issues with coloring the sealer if it is a earthtone color because anything darker may exceed the recommended maximum amount of coloring you are allowed to add. You can also use Kills sealer but you will need at least 2 coats. The other advantage to using sealer is you do not need to prepare the paneling so it will stick unless the paneling is covered with grease or oil. In that case I would use a degreaser that has orange oil in it. <SEP> How do I paint wood paneling? I know it sounds tacky but it's my only option at this point.

Jerry069 has a very good answer, it also depends on what you are trying to do.

The glass doors ride on wheels in a track on the top rails. They are removed typically by holding onto the door and then lifting the wheels out of the track and the doors come off. Sometimes they are just riding in a track and you can lift them straight up and out, and sometimes there are smaller holes in the track that you have to line the wheels up with in order to get them out. If you take off the doors you might not have to take off the rails if it is OK with the rails in place (and then you can put the doors back when the baby grows up!)Once you take the doors off then you can see how the rails are affixed to the tub/wall. Typically there will be screws on the end of the rail that extend into the wall (typically the bottom rail isn't screwed into the tub). Take the screws out. The top rail should come off pretty much when you take out the screws. The bottom rail also has silicone sealant on it. You can carefully cut away the biggest parts of the silicone to get the bottom rail off. Then you can carefully scrape off the remaining silicone.Hope this helps. All in all not a difficult job, although tedious getting the silicone sealant off. <SEP> How do you remove glass shower doors and railings on a bath tub?

First, don't go directly down the drain. If you are snaking a sink, remove the p trap and go in from there. If you are snaking a tub, remove the overflow cover and go in from there. If you are snaking a toilet, it is best to remove the toilet and go directly in the pipe so you don't scratch or mar the porcelain. Push the snake in until it won't go anymore then tighten the locking wingnut or squeeze the handle, whatever mechanism there is, to lock the snake in place, and start turning the handle. This will eventually push the snake past whatever stopped you, whether it was the clog or just a bend in the pipe. Whenever I snake a drain, I run the full length of the coil into the pipe just to make sure I got everything. When you've reached the end of the coil and start pulling it back out, make sure you're cranking the handle. This will clean out all the accumulated crap stuck to the walls of the pipe, to reduce the chance of future clogs. <SEP> How do you use a snake to clean out a drain? <EOS>

If there are no screws (but I'm sure there are at least a couple) then the only thing holding the door panel on are a series of plastic pieces that snap into holes in the metal door panel.

There is no way you can tell if the companies can get access to your files, and given that they could probably bypass your password for login - it's likely that they could get to your files if they really wanted to.  The only way to be 100% sure that you alone have access to your files is to encrypt them or host the service yourself. In the latter case, you should be aware that any large company is probably going to be able to do backup and security better than you.  Finally - A company like dropbox has better things to do than to go through your files. I would suggest that for larger / more well known companies, your files will probably be safe. Firstly because their businesses rely on you trusting them and secondly, because you're just one account in a myriad of accounts. <SEP> Can I trust dropbox and similar services? [closed] <EOS>

despite what people think. alot of companies now do make custom parts for home brew turbo kits. obviously tuning companies will have reasearched the situation much more than me or you would be able too. But a generic build would require dropping of the compression ratio (low comp pistons) and a low pressure turbo would be your best bet (something like a standard unit from say a nissan 200SX S13 series - Garret T25). you will need an intercooler too just for piece of mind. The biggest issue on the whole idea would be the management and the fueling. Your best bet on that would be a honda modding site as there are plenty of people who have taken that route with the B16 and B18 engines and reached power in the region of 300+. if anyone can help you out it would be them.The biggest money eater in any conversion is the installation labour as a tuner/garage will charge a small fortune to get the parts in the car, if your competant or have people who are and can help you could build up the block out of the car yourself, fit it and then get it set up and mapped on the rollers and most defo save money. <SEP> How can u build an inexpensive turbo kit?

Some real old furnaces have a small metal post above the pilot light.  You have to heat the post and hold the pilot button pushed in.  the pilot will keep the post hot. This is a safety feature. If the light goes out, the post will cool down and cut off the gas.  This system is used in most propane hot water tanks in RV's.  The same principle applies in modern electronic ignition furnaces.

An oil fired boiler doesn't have a pilot flame like a gas boiler does. It fires up automatically when the thermostat calls for heat just like a gas boiler. If the burner flame fails to ignite after about a 30 second timeout period at start up, the burner motor shuts down because you don't want to be spraying oil into the combustion chamber if the flame's not lit. The red button can be pushed once (and only once) to try to restart the burner if it times out after trying to start automatically as it normally does. But usually it won't start and just ends up spraying more oil into the combustion chamber. This is a dangerous condition for the oil repairman because once he fixes the original problem which caused the timeout and failure of the burner to light, the burner may start explosively due to all the excess oil in the combustion chamber. So don't press the red button more than once, and don't hold the red button in. When the repairman arrives, tell him how many times you pressed the red button so he'll know what safety measures to take to restart the burner once it's repaired. <SEP> how do I start a Boiler?

Judge the severity of the scratch and start with the finest grit sanding pad to remove the scratch. Rub over scratch in a straight line to remove it. Periodically switch rubbing direction 90°. Be sure all of the scratch is removed. If this first step takes too long, try the next heavier grit sanding pad. To minimize dust during sanding, wet the surface. Rinse pad periodically to clean residue. Clean top with water. Select next lighter grit and repeat process. Rub over a larger area to blend in sanding. Continue process using successively finer grits until desired gloss level is achieved. for more info check out: <SEP> how do I get scratches out of corian counter tops? <EOS>

The snake and camera are for sewer pipes.  To locate a pressure water leak you need A subsurface listening device such as geophones or fischer locators.  These are like stethoscopes only louder.  I hook up an air compressor to the water line via hosebib.  This makes the leak much louder.  It takes a lot of experience to locate a slab leak so I would suggest calling a slab leak specialist/plumber to locate it for you.  Sewer leaks you can find by performing a hydrostatic test and locate.  Also pretty tricky.  You use test balls to stop up the sewer and fill the drain with water.  If the water in the pipe drops you let the air out of the test ball and move it a couple of feet andtry again.  I would also recommend a plumber for this or it will take forever.  Experienced plumbers will know how to isolate the sewer pipes to make the job faster.  It takes me about two hours to do a full test and locate for drain leaks.  Around $275 to locate water leaks. $475 for sewer.  The smart plumbers will charge by the hour on sewer because it can take all day depending on how many leaks and access. <SEP> How can I locate a broken water pipe under a concrete foundation?

You'd be money and sleepless-nights ahead if you just cutout the area around the toilet ALL-THE-WAY back to the joists.. You are asking for an eventual dry-rot situation.Do this test...Make sure you are in a joist space (IE not over a joist) and you are not close to a water pipe. At 3ft away from the toilet, drill a 1/4" hole all the way through..  note the effort required..  repeat the test at 2ft and at 6" from the toilet ring... is the floor SOLID at each spot?  If so, then your plan will work... though you should give the floor a week to dry out.1/4 ply is NOT a structural layer.. its only used to underlay floorcoverings, like vinyl.  I would take ALL the 1/4 layer off and re-evaluate whether to do a sub-floor splice of 3/4 ply around the toilet.Also, try to evaluate WHY the wax ring was leaking... IS the toilet flange flush with the existing floor?  If not and its below the floor by any more than 1/4", you may have your answer WHY!!  You need to have the flange FLUSH to the final grade..  TThere are waxless rings that may work better for you. <SEP> how to repair water damaged sub floor? I went to replace floor tiles in bathroom and discovered the wax ring in the toilet had been leaking for some time.  I removed the top layer of 1/4 in plywood and the next layer is saturated too, but doesnt appear to be rotting.  I am unsure if I should continue trying to dry it or just cut it out as well.  Structurally, it should be OK as is, because I will replace the 1/4 in ply and add another on top of that.  THOUGHTS, SUGGESTIONS? <EOS>

Bleach will not strictly KILL it. If it happens to get to walls, removal of the drywall is the best step.   I recently replaced 11,000 sq. ft. of flood damaged drywall attacked by black mold, after the management attempted bleach.   Black mold attacks absorbent, welcoming surfaces. In the case of drywall, black mold only attacks the paper and paint, not the gypsum.

Fortunately it's easy, if a little repetitive, to get the stains out. Here's how. Steps In a spray bottle, mix up a solution of 1/2 warm water and 1/2 white vinegar. Spray the stained area with the solution. Press a dry terrycloth towel over the wet area. Remove the towel when it's soaked. Repeat until the stains are gone. Tips If you don't want to spend a whole day doing this, apply the solution whenever you happen to be driving. Just remember to remove the towel promptly and let the carpet dry out. Don't be discouraged by a deep-rooted stain. It will come out eventually. Warnings Avoid the temptation to rub the stained area.

to correctly check your pressure tank you must first turn off the breaker/power to well .   Drain the tank by using the closet drain to the pressure tank. We install a water bib on the tank tee for this reason. Once you have drained all water  wiggle tank and see if it still has water in it. If it is heavy with water your bladder has developed a pinhole and the tank needs replaced. If bladder is good all water will leave tank.   NEXT using an airgauge check air in tank , it should be @ 28 lbs if your pressure switch is set to come on at 30lbs  . NEVER should they have 50lbs of air!   If you have a gauge on your tank tee and it is working correctly which they do fail fairly easy . You can find your cut in pressure by turning on power and refilling pressure tank. Once full turn on water somewhere and watch gauge on tee to see where the pressure switch kicks on and calls for water. You want to set your air pressure lower than the cut in pressure by at least 2 lbs. If you have any questions e-mail me and I will answer your questions. DO not listen to the previous answers.

inline 6's are pretty good. with a few mods, you can make that straight 6 compete with the v8's. But for your question...need to know a few things.

Second, you may need to strengthen you front end to support the weight of a heavy stock V8. 3rd, if you have a front wheel drive vehicle, then you may have clearance issues with the hood and engine compartment. If it's rear wheel drive then i'd say take the tranny out of the camaro too and figure a way to get that in there. so, after all that, look on the on the internet for an adapterplate to go inbetween your japanese tranny to your american motor. also you may need to change (i think) the flywheel on your american motor, as well as other stuff on the japanese tranny. you will also have big mounting issues trying to put that v8 amercian standard (inches) into a japanese (metric) system. you'd need the motor mounts and...gosh, really, it would be much simpler to modify your straight 6. they put out some really good power. <SEP> How to convert an Inline 6 for a 91 Supra to a V8?

Cave and camel crickets are of little economic importance except as a nuisance in buildings and homes, especially basements. They are usually "accidental invaders" that wander in by mistake from adjacent areas. They generally do not reproduce indoors, except in situations that provide continuous dark, moist conditions as well as organic debris to serve as food.Control efforts for camel crickets should include (as much as is practical) eliminating breeding and hiding sites outdoors around the house or building. Piles of bricks, stones, boards, leaves, etc., should be removed. Also, cracks and gaps in foundation or siding or around windows and doors should be sealed. House centipedes are a natural predatory form of control, but most homeowners are uncomfortable having them around, despite their beneficial nature. Occasional, individual crickets can be easily picked or swept up and discarded. If there is a breeding population and chemical control is desired, spraying a residual barrier of diazinon, Dursban or Sevin insecticide around the outside of the house may be of benefit if you apply sufficient spray to reach breeding sites. Spraying household "ant and cockroach" insecticide onto indoor floor areas where camel crickets hide or are seen is a last resort of limited benefit. <SEP> How do I get rid of camel crickets?

Well you have dirt in the line.This does happen alot dont worry.1st remove the sullpy line from the faucet and tuen the water on point the supply line in a bucket flush the line out if it does not shoot water then remove the line from the valve and trun it on then. if the siuuply is a flex line you could run a hanger through it to clean it.See you have no water but you dont know where the water is stopping or jammed up at so if there is water at the valve and through the supply line then the problem is in the faucet.Ill get back to that. If for some reason no or little water from the valve your gonna need to remove the valve and clean or replace, Now back to the faucet.if there is water going to the faucet but none at the faucet  you need to clean out the faucet. if it was lets say a single handle delta faucet you would need a alan wrench and remove the handle then unscrew the top and remove cartdridge and clean. But how you asked your question it seems like you tryed to fix your faucet and didnt get it done correct or found it to hard to do. if this is the case you will need to get a plumber out there to fix it.This is a very common problem in plumbing you shut the valve off to do work and when you turn it back on it wont turn on or off all the way or it kicks up dirt and clogs the line. this happens more so in old houses but it will happen also in new homes.

I started a job like this once and had half the lino up before I learned that you can just go over it with the new floor.   So, I got some floor leveling compound to "rise up" the area that I had already pulled off in order to get everything level again.If going over it with peel and stick tiles, I would recommend priming the floor in order to achieve better adhesion.If cement board is in order, because you are going with ceramic tile... you can get cement board as thin as 1/4" so that you don't raise the floor so much that your counters become noticably short.

Shut down your boiler then you'll have to drain the system below the lowest part of the radiator you want to remove. If your lucky there might be shut off valves specific to the radiator that can be closed to avoid draining the entire system. Use due caution with these valves. If they don't hold all of the water above you will be ON YOU fairly quickly. Next   you'll need to break the unions on the piping. For this you'll need a couple of 18 or 24" pipe wrenches and some strength depending how old it is. Remove everything back to the pipe nipple and close it up with some pipe caps.I'm not sure what your skill level or ambition is but this can turn into a headache pretty quick if you were to break a fitting or had an issue isolating your system. Even if everything goes smooth you'll still need a couple of friends to move the radiator if it's cast iron 'cause they weigh a ton. Good Luck. <SEP> how do I remove a hot water radiator? <EOS>

first you have 2 hoses to hookup- the water hose and the hose that came with your pressure washer- the water hose is simple to figure out- the pressure washer hose is easy too once you know how - most pressure washers have slide couplers on them - their usually brass and the either slide forward or back - u have male and female adapters and you insert accordingly - make sure your spray gun is hooked up also- turn your water on, make sure you have fuel in your machine.  If you look down beside your fuel tank you should see the choke, throttle, on/off swicth, and possibly a primer- if theres a primer there will be instructions as to how many times to push it - turn your on/off switch to the on position- choke your carberator, again there should be directions as to where the choke position is - but after that you are ready to go - pull the rope and when it starts take it out of the choke position- usually it'll crank but cut off b/c the choke is on but once you get it running all you have to do is decide on what tip u want to use- your spray gun will have a lock on it so you may want to apply it while you're inserting it in your gun --- something good to remember is that the wider the tip opening, the wider the spray field- wide spraying tips are used for applying or misting the object before you pressure wash it, be extremely careful with tips that have small openings b/c they can cause serious damage to whatever you are spraying- i recommend using your #2 or #3 tip  -- you'll develop a feel for the spray gun fairly easy and then you'll be able to decide how close or far back you need to stand from an object to be effective- also remember to wear safety glasses <SEP> How to operate a craftsman 2550 pressure washer? <EOS>

Certainly the removal of old grout is the first step. You don't state its condition, or if you just want to change a grout color?   Its a messy job, or can be, and care to not break any tiles.   Re grouting: When you go to a home store you will see various colors certainly, and two types of grout usually,,,SANDED and NON SANDED. One applied and dry either will work, the differences are in the width of grout lines,,, IE: Non sanded recommended for wider lines.   Mix only small amounts at a time, apply with a plastic putty knife if you don't want to invest in a runner face trowel, buy the wipe off sponge, allowing for the grout lines to be filled to overflowing, gently, with a DAMP sponge, wipe away excess. As the grout sets and dries you can apply a wetetr sponge in cleanup. The dust left behind once dry is easily wiped away.   You might also buy sealer, for the grout allowing it to be less absorbent, though I have no stats on effectiveness.Rev. Steven <SEP> How do you regrout the bathroom/shower tiles?

Update:  The following is an answer from 2011. Obviously the right answer changed from that time as there is a better answer in 2014. Please note the 3 year difference before voting on the answer.  Keeping for archival reasons only, original answer:  I have checked the related Google Groups and Support threads. Obviously, it's not supported (and looks like no soon plan to be, although not 100% sure about this one).  The way I do now is export to Excel and apply the filter there, then find a likely unique value (or repeats few times) in the sheet to correlate the row in the Google Spreadsheet (by finding it in the Google sheet) and apply the required modifications. Not optimal, still hoping for per-user fllter support. <SEP> Multi user filter issue in Google Spreadsheets <EOS>

i think you are experincing caliper slap. you need to have your brakes done..if its that wore that it has enough space to "clunk" it is wore. and common sence tells me if one side is that wore...the other side wont be far behind. there are a few diff ways to do it, you can replace all the hardware...or get the spacers...no yours is not the first like this so they make a lil spacer to go in there to take up the extra space.i think the fact you put air in your tire at the same time has little or nothing to do with it....BUT i would look at the front end upper/lower ball joints, pitman arm, drag link, inner and outer tie rod ends, check your bearings  repack em.    what im saying is if you dont know your way around the front end of a truck...take it somplace that does or you could end up spending ALOT more later. i just had one where a chick lost her lower ball joint on the freeway...luckly she dident kill herself or somone else. cost her bout 100 bucks for the ball joint and 1500 more in fixing the repairs of it coming unglued at 75 mph! <SEP> How do I adjust the front disc brakes on a Dodge Dakota?

would not recommend muffs on an inboard engine. if ya do, do not run the engine much above idle RPMs. muffs and a water hose cannot suppy enough water fast enough to properly cool your engine. as they are not the most efficient means. normally only one side of the intake is fed, and more water is lost than actually taken in.its ok for simple things like, just flushing through, after salt water use, or maybe to winterize, but for any major operation, where high rpms are required, id hook the water hose up to the engine, directly. depending on engine and set up, will depend on where to hook the hose to. probably have better luck, asking a local marine shop, who probably can tell you depending on your engine.not all sterndrives use a leg fed water intake, which muffs are designed to fit over, like on outboards. some use pick up tubes, which muffs are useless on. <SEP> How do you hook up a water line to an inboard engine to run it out of water.? <EOS>

The tools you need:Stirring implementPlasterSpatulasSandpaperPaintSpongeSelect a spatula that's slightly wider than the hole you are filling. Also select one or two smaller spatulas you can use for touch-up work.Preparing the plaster: Open the plaster. If the plaster is in a can, use a screwdriver or an old table knife to pry off the lid. Use a wooden stick or spoon to stir the plaster. Make sure it's smooth, with no lumps or liquid. Applying the plaster to the hole: Use the spatula to spread plaster over the hole. Spread the plaster in only one direction, making sure to spread it beyond the boundaries of the hole.  After the plaster is dry, you can use a smaller spatula to touch up any areas that are not completely filled in. After the plaster is completely dry, use the sandpaper to lightly sand the surface. Make sure the plaster is nice and smooth right out to the edge of the hole and beyond.Painting the area: Using a sponge that matches the surface of the wall, practice dabbing paint on the cardboard. Keep practicing until you can duplicate the texture of the wall.  Use the same sponge (or sponges) to dab paint over the patch. Make sure you match the texture of the surrounding wall.  You can go back over the paint either while it's wet or after it dries. Try to get the texture just right. <SEP> How do I repair a hole in the wall?

You set the time on most mechanical clocks by gently moving the minute hand in a clockwise direction until you reach the current time, then start the pendulum. Do not move the hour hand, it will move automatically when you move the minute hand and do not move either hand counter clockwise.The chimes are mechanically linked to the minute and hour hands so the chimes are automatically set when you set the time.

Raise front of car and support it on jack stands unless working clearance under car is adequate. Place pan beneath drain plug. Loosen plug with wrench, then remove plug by hand. Let old oil drain into pan. Clean drain plug and washer with rags. Some plugs are magnetized to trap metal particles. he old filter must be loosened with a filter wrench. After loosening, it should be removed carefully by hand so that no oil is spilled. The gasket of the new filter is then lubricated with clean engine oil, and the filter is threaded on by hand. Follow the filter manufacturer's instructions for proper tightening procedures. Replace plug and washer as soon as the oil has drained. Start plug by hand and tighten it as far as possible. When plug is seated, tighten it another half-turn with a wrench. Find oil filler, add amount of oil given in owners manual, 1 quart less if filter is not changed. Start engine and check for leaks at drain plug. Lower car. Check oil level; adjust if necessary.  Then Start your engine up and check for oil leaks. (Note; the engine oil warning light might stay on for a few seconds.) Stop engine and check oil level.And its as simple as THAT! Don't forget your oil filter and of course your new oil!

yes. simply dont hook up the ground. first, make sure the tool is double insulated (look on the nameplate for a symbol of a box inside another box, or the words double insulated)your tool should have this due to the 2 coductor cable you've mentioned. cut the existing cord cap off of the tool, strip back the outer sheathing of the cable carefully not to nick the inner conductors. if u can see wires note colors, the black wire is going to go in the brass screw terminal of your new cord cap this is your "hot wire"and the white wire is going to go under the silver screw terminal this is youre neutral wire". the green terminal is your ground simply dont land a wire on this terminal. note you'll only be able to use this tool in a grounded 3 wire recepticale. don't worry these are a common code practice. if your cable is similar to lamp cable then look for some type of identification on the wire such as a ribbed stripe in the insulation itself or writing on a wire. this wire is your neutral wire the other is your hot. follow above instructions. also note, do not leave any extra free conductor of wire and dont strip more outer sheathing than you need. remember you want it to end up in the cord cap.good luck <SEP> how do you replace a male connector on a power tool? my tool has a two mprong connector but the connector i bought has a ground is it still compatible <EOS>

Strobe Lights can be purchased at many auto parts locations.  They are however, illegal to operate while the vehicle is in motion.  Impersonating an emergency vehicle.  To install one, you need to put it someplace where it won't get wet.  Most of them that I have seen, would simply drill a small hole on the inside of an existing turn signal housing.  Make it the same size or slightly larger than the strobe light itself.  Then you just put the strobe in the hole and seal with silicone to prevent water leakage.  Then wire it to a switch to turn on.  Basically it's as easy as installing a new light.  Like I said though, don't get caught using it on the road. <SEP> How do i install strobe lights on a car? <EOS>

The best way to do this from my experience is to tie a function to a button/image. The only drawback is that you cannot pass parameters along with a script assigned to a button. Due to this you will need to make a function specific to each navigation but they can call be a in a single script file.  Steps:  Create an image (Insert -> image) and style it to your preference  Create a custom function with the following:  function showSheetByName(Name) {    var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();    var sheet = ss.getSheetByName(Name);    SpreadsheetApp.setActiveSheet(sheet); }  and then a function specific to your button  function showSheet5() {    showSheetByName("Sheet5"); }  Finally assign this function to your button  Assign Script... showSheet5  You should now be able to click on your button and navigate to "Sheet5". This can also be modified to go to a specific area of the sheet as well. <SEP> Link to specific sheet in Google spreadsheet <EOS>

Try here:  http://www.ehow.com/how_17787_remove-super-glue.htmlSuperglue (cyanoacrylate) has many uses. Besides the typical household function of sticking things together, it's used in surgical procedures and even in crime labs to develop unseen fingerprints. Originally marketed as Eastman #910 in 1958, this stuff is sneaky and it goes everywhere if you don't keep an eye on it.          Steps:  1.   Clean up any glue that is still wet by blotting it with a white paper towel or terry cloth towel.    2.   Soak the object in warm soapy water if possible and try rubbing off as much as you can.    3.   Pour a little bit of acetone-base nail polish remover on a white terry cloth.    4.   Dab at the dried glue until it dissolves.    5.   Use extra fine sandpaper to remove dried glue from the surface of an object.    6.   Try a product called Goof-Off or Z-7 Debonder.        Tips:   Hold a folded white cloth on the back of fabrics to keep the acetone from soaking through other layers.     Acetone may affect colors or melt plastic fibers, such as some nylons or carpet. Test it on a hidden area first.        Warnings:   Don't use solvents such as gasoline or paint thinner. <SEP> How can I get super glue off the carpet? <EOS>

Ok I posted a link below for you to follow, very good source there. Now the DRL or daytime running lamps are something completely different, they are on all the time until you switch on the headlights. Now the auto headlights have a little black sensor on top of the dash by your defroster vents that turn on your headlights when it senses that the light outside is getting dim. They flip on going under bridges and everything else and get a little annoying. Did I follow you right on that one? Now if you want to kill the daytime running lamps do what is suggest above, open the hood and look for the big underhood fuse box and on the lid of that box there will be a diagram on there of what all the fuses and relays are for. Pull the black or gray relay that goes to the drl's and you are done. There is absolutely nothing bad about pulling them. They are NOT for the people who cannot see and not for the handicapped, people who cannot see a car are obviously not going to see lights during the daytime anyway. Their was a research project done back in 95 or 96 saying they did help visibility and reduce crashes but their were several more projects done that proved that wrong and some even said they were distracting. Look now, most vehicles do not have them, some run just front park lamps and a few have drls but the majority of the companies killed the drls, what is suggested below works but it also drags the rear brakes some and keeps either your drums or discs pretty hot. I used one of those infared thermometers and found mine were in fact dragging with one click enough to heat up the rear brakes substantially. <SEP> how can i deactivate auto headlights on a 99 chevy blazer? <EOS>

the most common AFCI devices sre installed in the circuit breaker box. just like the standard circuit breaker. check the switch on the AFCI to see if it is tripped.

Wow, how old is that system? A lot of times with these old systems the problem is that the inlet tee (they used to be concrete, molded into the tank) deteriorates causing a grease clog at that end of the tank, so it's constantly clogging up. I'd check that out before you dig up the whole line. However if you're sure the line needs replacing, dig it up just uncovering the top of the pipe for the whole length. Once that's done you can break the clay pipe in sections and take it out while maintaining the pipe bed (so you'll be sure to have the correct fall on the new pipe). If yours is a residence replace the clay pipe with 4" sch40 PVC. The stub-out at the house end will likely be cast iron in which case you'll need a flexible coupling (rubber with tightening bands) to make that connection. At the tank end extend the new pipe into the tank a few inches and install a tee. A septic tank always has to have a tee inside the tank with a length of pipe extending downward to within about 18" of the bottom of the tank. This forces any grease and solids down into the tank and keeps the layer of floating scum away from the inlet. I think it goes without saying, but I'd have the tank pumped before attempting to replace the tee. New systems require a filter on the other end of the tank to keep any solids from entering the field lines.   I don't know if I'd go to that trouble with this old system, that's a matter of personal opinion. However, I've done repairs where the field lines were full of panty liners (they don't degrade), where a filter would have saved them. Good Luck <SEP> How do you change a septic system line from ceramic  pipe to PVC pipe? <EOS>

Most of the time a capret extractor is used to clean upholstery, but you should NOT do this!

The professional way is to remove the old trim and replace it. You say you will be patching anyway, so removing the trim shouldn't be a problem. Clean the stucco with a pressure washer before you do any patching, that way if any weak spots come off, you can do the patching all at once. Rent a paint sprayer or, use a large nap roller for priming and painting as it will get in to the texure better. Keep a brush with you for stubborn spots. <SEP> How to repair or replace stucco, or trim built into stucco?

Thompson Water Seal is an oil based product.  The oil in the product causes water to bead up on the surface and tends to prevent the absorption of water.  Naturally, this oil needs to be refreshed fairly often in order to maintain protection.I would mix up a bucket of water and car wash soap and scrub the affected areas with a fairly soft bristled brush.  The soap will cause the oil in the water seal to break down after which it can be rinsed off.  Be sure and rinse thoroughly and rescrub if necessary.  This will give you a huge head start in getting rid of the Thompson's Water Seal.  Keep in mind that this brand of water seal loses its' effectiveness after as little as 6 months in a wet climate.I would also recommend using a stain blocking primer prior to painting your siding with a finish color.Good luck with your project. <SEP> How do you get Thompson's waterseal off of hardiplank siding without damaging the siding? <EOS>

Depends on if the plastic housing is broken or if it's just a bulb.Usually a bulb is accessed by removing the nuts holding the cardboard plate accross the back, moving the plate forward towards the back seat and the bulb assembly will rotate lft turn a bit and can then be backed out. On some the lamp is a push in. Just pull it out and slip a new one in.If the housing is broken it is strictly a dealer part.

The best way to make stucco look smooth (level?)is to spray it with something called a "hopper gun" which can be purchased usually in the paint dept. of any national hardware store such as Home Depot. Even with a hopper gun it is difficult... and if you have no experience I suggest practicing until you can get the look you desire. The instructions that come with the gun will help you get started but there is nothing like experience. There is infomation on the container of most stucco products that tell you how much water you can add to the material - water makes the product spray easier but slows drying time. While it is possible to spread stucco and get a smooth surface - this would take far more practice. If you want to check out the product I just put on the front of my own home (Tuff 2) here's the URL:http://www.styro.net/FoundationandICFCoatings.html.htmlI don't sell, own, or have any interest in this company but I can tell you from my experience they are extremely customer friendly--AND they have short videos of the application of stucco you can watch (if you have access to high speed internet) Hope this helps.....Jeff <SEP> how do you get stucco level on a wall?? <EOS>

hi sato...test the mix of epoxy? that could be a little difficult.  most manufacturers will supply 2 component epoxies as a kit with the proper ratio of "a" (epoxy paint) to "b" (hardener or catalyst)...there are literally dozens of epoxy types on the market (polyamide cure, polyamine cure, acrylic epoxy, etc) and many of them are now available in both a solvent-borne and water-borne solution.  each of these different epoxies may require a different ratio of part a to part b...most of the solvent-borne polyamide cures (standard workhorse of epoxy coatings) are a 1:1 mix and an induction time of 30-60 minutes is often required before applying converted product - and pot life is usually 8-12 hours before converted product should be discarded.   contrast that to a water-borne acrylic epoxy that may have a 16:1 mix with no induction time and a pot life of 24 hours.each epoxy product has different characteristics and usually recommended for different types of application from swimming pools to industrial floors to surfaces exposed to solvent splash and extreme moisture...i think the key here is to find a contractor that has experience in the application of epoxy coatings and has the knowledge to direct  you to the proper coating for your needs (a contractor will save no money or labor by cheating on the mixture of epoxy but can create a mess if the product is not converted properly)...also, get to know your local independent paint store dealer - he/she can provide you with a ton of information (application, technical, surface preparation, disposal, etc.) on these high performance coatings...i hope this info is helpful to you...good luck on your projectsric <SEP> How do i test the mix of my epoxy coating?

Old caulk is tough. Use DAP Caulk softener.  It applys like a paste over the odl stuff. Be sure to cut the edges with a knife first. Let it sit and after 20 minutes, use a scraper designed for bathtubs (also at Homedepot or Lowes) and scrape it off. The majority will come off now. You may have some small areas where you need to work it with the utility knife and apply more softener.Clean the entire area and rinse well and let dry. it is critical that it be dry and free of soap scum, mildew and caulk softener. Then get a good bathrub caulk. I like the ones with some sort of buiguartd to ward off mildew and recaulk. Apply a small line of caulk all around.

As a owner of a Range Rover and two Disco's I have to say I am supprised to hear that the speedy TR7 has twin carbs.For a book I would suggest you go to the LRO site, or buy one of their mags and look through the too many adverts and you will find books on offer along with many specialty shops that love to work on rover V8s.If you would like to get driving there is a rough and ready way. Pardon me if I miss some points as my book is not with me.Here we go:  Make sure you have just the PROPER amount of oil in each carb chamber, Make sure the linkage is or cable is adjusted so both carbs function as close to as alike as you can determine, now the fun part.Find  yourself some of that small 8mm or so clear plastic hose, about 3/4 of a meter in length get two if you can. Start your engine, put the hose near your ear (one end) and the other end just down the throat of the carb-Forgot to mention you need to have the aircleaner off.  You will hear the hissing of the fuel jet as the engine runs. Listen to each carb in turn.  You objective is to get the sound exactly the same as much as your calibrated ear can allow.Set the idle screws on each carb the same number of turns (remember to count how they were set. Now set the each carb bit by bit to get the engine idle to 600 or so RPM. Keep the sound the same between each of the carbs.The models of SU's on my Range Rover have fuel adjustment screws which I then cut them back till the engine goes rough and then open them evenly (to the sound) untill it goes smooth.  Check your work by reving the engine and listening you may have to fiddle one carb or the other just a little to keep the sound and have smooth exceleration.This can be really fustrating as things like big changes in humidity and temperature effect the fuel tuning.You may find it much more satisfying to take it to a reputable garage and watch as you wax on about the pleasures of owning a classic automoble or even less stress than that, ask when you can pick it up and if it is not too long spend the time in a pub-having lunch of course you should not drink and drive.Good Luck. <SEP> How do I Balance my twin SU's and how do I stop her running rich (Triumph TR7 V8 3500).

A few cleanings with it probably wouldnt make a difference, but if you continue to use it, the ammonia in the window cleaner will degrade the quartz in the granite and you will lose your shine over the long run!!! <SEP> how do you clean a granite countertop? <EOS>

the regulator is attached to the alternator.  to replace just that you need to first find a regulator, which most parts stores will not have.  it is more cost effective to replace the entire unit.At worst a regulator would have to be ordered, but you never know what a parts store might have, however, it is an isuzu, parts aren't readily available.on the alternator there will be at least 2 wires/plugs.  one is a threaded bolt, that is the alternator output.  the other is usually a plastic connector with 2-5 wires, that's where the regulator plugs in.  sometimes the entire alternator has to be dismantled to get to it, others just unscrew off the backside. <SEP> how to change the voltage regulator on a 87 isuzu trooper II?  where is it locate on the isuzu ?

Go to your local auto parts store and ask for the positive and negative cables for your car (but you probably only need a negative, that one all ways seems to take the worst beating).  When you get them you will see what is involved in changing them.  Like how many connectors there are on them etc.  It is not an overly difficult job and if you can change your own oil, air cleaner, etc. I don't think you will have any problems. <SEP> how do i change the battery cables on my ford taurus?

OK, before you go throwing countless dollars away on the rain-x and hi-dollar wiper ideas, think about this, and I'm not trying talk down, but sometimes we forget the obvious.  Your wipers are rubber, and the windshield is glass...the problem is, the wipers are hardening a bit and actually 'grabbing' the windshield when they pass.  The easiest fix is to a) treat the wipers with some household glass cleaner, the ammonia will soften the rubber, or b) run 'delayed' wipers in accordance with the rainfall, eg. don't run them full blast in a light drizzle. <SEP> How can I stop the windshield wipers on my vehicle from chattering?

Sounds like the gas has evaporated in the carburetor bowl.  When it evaporates it leaves a varnish film which will cover the jets and probably has the float needle stuck in it's jet.Do this:  Take the air filter off the carb, look down into the carb, take hold of the throttle linkage and move it to full throttle a couple of times.  You SHOULD see gas squirting into the throat of the carburetor.  If you don't it may still be the carb is stopped up, the fuel pump valves are stuck OR the gas filter is plugged up.   It is something that you will have to check. To check the flow of gas to the carb, take the gas line loose from the carb, put the end of the gas line in a suitable container and have someone turn the engine over.  If you get a good gas flow into the container, the fuel pump is ok.  Then lean more toward a stopped up carb.   Good luck.  Pops <SEP> How do I get my Ford 302 V8 running after it sits for a year?

You or a mechanic will have to find a loose connection somewhere between the fuse terminal board and the lights.  Since ALL the lights are going out, I would zero in on the wiring and/or the light switch that turns them on.   The best bet on loose connections is to turn the lights on, when it is dark, and begin to wiggle wires.  IF you make them flicker, go on or off, you are close to the problem.  Don't forget to wiggle the fuse and wiring around the fuse panel also.   Good luck.  Pops <SEP> How can I fix dashboard lights that keep going out? I bought a 2002 Honda Civic EX coupe from a used car dealer, and the dashboards lights went out the first day. Sometimes they go back on, then they go out again. (The red hands are lit but the "circles" behind them are pitch-black.)He has tried to fix it, but he told me the mechanic discovered there was an aftermarket device of some kind that changes the color of the light. He said the cool blue-green color I had liked so much is a result of this device and the light is normally white. He thinks the device is cheap and is causing the problem.After he replaced the bulb, the lights worked until I got home. The next day, they flickered out. I'm going back to the dealer tomorrow but I'm not optimistic that the problem will be fixed permanently.What can be done? <EOS>

Kinda like asking how do you build a 747.  There are many varibles, all of which determine the best answer.  Wood or vinyl or aluminum?  How much overhang?  Level of ability?

Damaged or rotted wood can be repaired using the "Bondo" type fillers.

You can use automatic transmission fluid to keep your tires shiny, giving similar results as Armor All.Be sure that they are clean first, then apply with a rag or a piece of cloth.EDIT:You said inexpensive, you can spend big bucks on those special costly tire product, or a buck or two on a quart of automatic transmission fluid that will last for several applications, this is the best bet, hands down if you are looking for value!To use this method you have to be smarter than 그림자 (that is not saying too much) and know to use it sparingly, not drown the tire in it.

Someone who knew the answer!Dc3402If you are doing it ON the car, I don't suggest actually blocking them though (you can break the node that rides on the distributor if your not careful) IF you do block them make sure whatever you use is NON Conductive - it is easier to pull the wire on one set of points, dwell the one, then change sides and dwell the other - use a GOOD dwell meter, not some cheap one that 'floats around' when it is running.Having your local race shop do it though is a LOT better. <SEP> how do i tune a dual points on my stang the car runs rough.? the engine is a 351W <EOS>
According to the website below:When your gas gauge reads empty, your tank is filled with air instead of fuel.  As you add fuel, the air must move out of the tank to make way for the gas.  Next time you fill your car at the gas station, take a look at the pump nozzle.  You will find a hole about a half inch from the end of the nozzle.  This hole is connected to a small pipe that travels through the nozzle to the handle.When you fill your gas tank, some of the displaced air flows through the hole in the nozzle into the pipe.  When the tank is full, the hole will be below the gasoline level and no air will pass through the pipe.  A mechanical switch inside the nozzle detects when the flow of air stops and shuts off the gas.You may have noticed that, after the pump shuts off, you can get more gas in your tank by pulling the nozzle out of the tank a bit.  This is because you’re moving the position of the hole relative to the gas level and allowing the mechanical switch to reopen. <SEP> How does the gas pump know when your tank is full? <EOS>
