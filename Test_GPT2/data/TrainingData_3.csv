No need to turn off any water,,, At least not initially.   The "P" trap under the sink is the place to begin, and should be easy to remove,,,using care certainly. The pipe that is the curved one...   You may be able, with just a large lock jaw pliers, to unscrew the connections.   Once apart flush the P trap with a hose or scoop out as much as you can of any debris... OR buy another.   The P trap is designed not only to trap gases/odors that may intrude from drain lines, but also manages to collect most everything else that fits down the drain.   If there is something wedged,,IE: hair pins etc, use a wire coat hanger to force the object out.   When replacing wou should have at hand new washers/gaskets to put back when connecting. You might also purchase the thread tape to ensure a better seal. Carefully rethread the connectors to the threaded down drains, assuring a tight fit, but not extreme fit, and turn on the tap.Rev.

Check the hose, wand and cleaning tools for obstructions. Debris often collects where one part plugs into another, or where the hose connects to the main vacuum housing. Remove the parts one at a time and remove any debris you find.  Clear any hidden obstructions by pushing a broom handle through the hose and wands.  Reassemble all the parts.  You may also have to replace the drive belt.1. Unplug the machine and flip it over so you can access the agitator brush.  2. Unscrew the bottom plate that holds the brush in place, using a screwdriver.    3. Lift out the brush by pulling the roller ends out of the slots in the vacuum base. If the drive belt isn't completely broken, one end will be wrapped around the agitator brush, the other around the motor drive shaft. Slide the belt off of each part. Take it to a hardware store to get a replacement.    4. Inspect the agitator brush before installing the new belt. Sometimes thread or hair will wrap around the ends or elsewhere on the brush roller. This can prevent the agitator from turning and cause a belt to fail prematurely. Cut any thread or hair with a sharp knife and pull it off.    5. Install the new belt. Slide one end over the agitator brush and the other over the drive shaft. Then reinstall the agitator brush. You may have to pull on the agitator brush to stretch the new belt a bit so the roller ends fit into the vacuum base.    6. Reinstall the bottom plate.<SEP>How to fix a vacuum cleaner?

How can I export my Google chat logs?<SEP>I have figured out a way to get them out via forwarding them, using a browser scripting tool call iMacros.  I think this macro will only work with Firefox 3.6 which you can get from this link .  I wont go into installing and setting either of them up, but here is the macro I used.  VERSION BUILD=7300701 RECORDER=FX TAB T=1 FRAME F=4 TAG POS=1 TYPE=SPAN ATTR=CLASS:hE&&TXT:Reply WAIT SECONDS=.5 TAG POS=1 TYPE=TEXTAREA FORM=NAME:NoFormName ATTR=NAME:to CONTENT=test@GMAIL.COM TAG POS=1 TYPE=DIV ATTR=TABINDEX:1&&ROLE:button&&TXT:Send WAIT SECONDS=3 TAG POS=1 TYPE=IMG ATTR=ALT:&&SRC:images/cleardot.gif&&CLASS:iHkD0e&&TXT: WAIT SECONDS=2  Just replace 'test@gmail.com' with the email address you want to forward to.  Now the only other key piece of advice is where to start the loop of the macro.  To do it right, you will want to create a label and assign all your gmail chats to it.  This will allow you to see your chats in chronological order and forward them that way.  Then in gmail click on the label, when the list opens it will likely open to the newest first.  Therefore, go the the last page of the labels contents.  Open the last item.  here is when you click "play loop" in iMacros.  I had 1k chats to export.  You'll notice there are "wait" statements in the code, this will give the browser time to keep up. They may need tweaking.  Also, check back every couple of minutes, because it sometimes throws an error, or tries to move to the next (newer) chat before the email has been sent.  Just click "cancel" and it will go back to the script and the email will have been sent.  If it throws any other errors during operation, you should be able to adjust the loop duration and start it again with no problems.  This has been aggravating me for so long since I switched Gmail accounts due to spam, so I am finally happy to close that account having got all my content out.<EOS>

They should be able to tell you why its on & turn it off for you unless there is an active issue that requires repair & will only turn the light back on.

If the problem is the bolt does not line up properly with the stike you can adjust the stike plate. This is sometimes caused by normal settling of the structure. There are several things you can check if this is an existing lock. First check and see if all your hinges are screwed in tight, if the hinge screws have loosened over a period of time this will cause the door to sag slightly and cause a misalignment. Second make sure the screws is the lockset are properly tightened. In the case of typical entry knobs and dead bolts it is best to tighten the latch bolts first and than the screws through the lockset.If every thing else seems up to snuff you can place a small amount of paint on the bolt while the bolt is retracted. Close the door and work the knob or the lockset a couple of times. This will leave a mark on the door jamb or strike plate where the lock bolt is hitting. You will than be able to determine where the strike plate may need be adjusted or the hole enlarged.<SEP>How to repair a door lock that does not line up with the hole in the frame?

There are several sources for car history- State DMVs.  Very slow to respond.  They only have details on registrations and brands - when a car has major damage a brand is added.  Also, they will only have data for one state - if the car has moved they can't help you.  Fees vary by state.  The best source is Carfax.  They collect data from over 8000 sources - and still they don't have everything.  However, it's the most comprehensive source.  For free - since it costs the DMVs and Carfax - nobody provides it for free.<SEP>How can I find out about the history of a used car I just bought FOR FREE?

MSD makes a box for that. I'ts the MSD 6A. try increasing the spark and you can run a bit leaner. If you look at the Hemi engine you'll see its built for flow. think about having the heads port and polished. also getting the valves turned. The less work load the engine has the less heat it will in retrospect have to produce. when your fuel is delivered it may also be sent up from the frame rail around the motor. Lean away from heat conducting hoses I.E. braided lines. Let the carb atomize the fuel not the hose. Change the carb and intake manifold. For your application I would use Edelbrock gear. Think 1406 carb.<SEP>How do I make my Truck more Gas Efficient? I bought an old Chevy K5 Blazer Full Size 350 from 1984.  I love this truck!

Jack the car up a little, pull the center nut(s) off the upper shock tower, then pull the mounting bolt off the lower end and slide off the shock. Be careful not to let the new one extend until you have it bolted in place, may be a little difficult collapsing it again. Suggestion: Use some WD-40 or some such a few minits before you try to loosen up anything. You may find it in your best interest to take off the tire, give yourself as much room to work in as you can. Get an "Idiot" book, I've found them to be very useful.

.if the scratch isn't too big it can be polished with toothpaste. Just apply a small amount to scratch and with a soft cloth rub in circles. If the scratch is too big it will need to be taken to a repair shop try a windshield repair shop.

If I understand the question, you want to know what the problem may be when the problem IS NOT that the system is undercharged? If the system is fully charged is your compressor cycling? If not, do you have power to the compressor? The system may have enough charge but if the pressures on the high side and the low side are not right the system will not operate properly. If the high side pressure is too high there is probably a restriction and a high pressure switch will shut the compressor off to prevent more pressure from building up. How do you know it doesn't need to be charged? If a shop looked at it they probably checked the pressure (or they should have) so find out what they were. Need more info for a more specific diagnosis.<SEP>How do you know what parts to replace on air conditioning in your vehicle, when its not a charge needed?

Oil it.  I would not put a clear finish on it.  Get a good quality furniture oil for light wood, it should be about the color of honey.  Clean off the dust with compressed air.  Oil it and let it soak in for a month.  Use wooden pegs and drilling to repair cracks.  OK no oil, I just love the natural finish though.No oil:  Change your work schedule and work in the wettest time of the year for your area after your trunk has had a chance to soak up some humidity.  Don't wet it  (although a wash might not hurt) unless you plan on sanding it.  Just make sure it's evenly exposed. prop it up in the air if necessary.  Hang up the wash nearby, etc.  Try using larger clamps and protect your trunk with pieces of scrap wood between it and the clamps.   Work slowly.<SEP>How do I  revitalize, replenish moisture into old dried out wood? I am restoring an old wooden trunk.

How can I filter my Gmail messages that aren't labeled?<SEP>One way you can do it is by using the minus operator on the label operator. So for example:  -label:tag-a -label:tag-b -label:tag-c  or for one-word tags:  -label:{taga tagb tagc}  This is probably only practical if you don't have a lot of labels.  Additionally, if they don't change often, you can include a link to this search so that it easily accessible from Gmail. There is a Google Labs product which puts a box of links on the left side and allows you to customize them. Just add a link to this search query and you'll be able to access your untagged messages easily.  It seems like there is a greasemonkey script which will work too. Here is the script's website . It creates a special label, Unlabelled , to search for all the conversations without a real label.<EOS>

First you have to jack up the car and support it with jackstands remove the wheels and the center axle nuts (do this before removing the brake calipers so someone can hold the brake for you to get them loose). On some cars it is possible to leave the calipers and rotors onbut not all the time. Next seperate the outer tie rod and ball joint and ush down on the a arm with a large pry bar to swing the strut out of the way. Next pull the axle out of the spindle, It might have to be tapped with a hammer to break it loose. After it is out of the spindle you can try pulling the axle out of the transmission by yanking on it a couple of times but it generally wont be that easy you will have to get under the car with a pry bar and pry it loose from the tranny. Be careful not to pry against the seal in the tranny. Also transmission fluid might come pouring out of the tranny when the axle is removed so dont lay directly under it and have a drain pan ready. To remove the transmission you are probably going to have to take it out the bottom. At this stage you can remove the torque converter bolts, tranny mounts, exhaust, shift cables, wiring, speedometer cable if you have one, and bell housing bolts. Then you can soosten the subframe bols on the engine side about half way out and with a floor jack support the tranny side of the frame and remove the sub frame bolts on that side. Slowly let the subframe down about 6 inches and stop look at your motor and make sure that nothing is binding. If it looks like the transmission will slide out under the body you can then support the motor with a piece of wood running from one strut tower to the other and a strap from that piece of wood to the motor. I like to use a 4x4 for this because it is strong enough. After the motor has been supported you can let the subframe down more and pull the transmission up off of the subframe and out from under the car. Also pay special attension to the dipstick tube it might have to be removed to do this.<SEP>how do i re move axils from a fwd car? i want to take out the trany only<EOS>
If you are looking at your gas meter, you should see four dials straight in a row. Pay close attention to the numbers on the dial and the rotation of the pointer. The first dial should be read counterclockwise. Record the number the pointer has just passed. For example, if the pointer is between the number 4 and the number 5, for dial one, the number would be 4 (counterclockwise dial, the number the pointer just passed). The second dial should be read clockwise. Record the number the pointer just passed. For example, if the pointer is between the number five and the number 6, for dial number two, the number would be 5. The third dial is read exactly like the first, counterclockwise and the number the pointer has just passed. The fourth dial is read clockwise, but this time record the number the pointer is nearest. To determine how much gas you have consumed this month, record your meter reading today. Then come back one month from today and record your meter reading again. Then subtract last's months reading from this month's reading to calculate how many ccf's of gas you've used.<SEP>how do you read a natural gas meter?<EOS>

I am assuming you have laminate on plywood or MDF that you want to salvage discarding only the laminate.If the old laminate is loose due to bad contact cement application. initially it might be easy. Otherwise a lot of scraping is in your future.The hardest part is to get off the old laminate and any cement underneath it. If it is loose try sliding a paint scraper under it and prying up gradually. If not tap the scraper under the edging and try to get that off first with prying. Then start on the top sheet of laminate and slip the scraper under it and pry it. Repeat until all the laminate is off. Next look at the cement left on the plywood surface. Clean it off with a sanding block of about 200 grit.When cement is gone and laminate is in the dumpster, just get the new laminate, new contact cement, roller, some newspapers, and  either a router or a laminate trimmer. Just follow the application directions for the new laminate (with the most important being that wherever you put it down it is going to want to stick).<SEP>How do you Re-Laminate kitchen countertops?<EOS>
If you are working with concrete you may want to start at the top of the hill and work downward.  This way gravity helps you pull the concrete into place.  If you had the limestone delivered in a concrete mixer, called pugging, then you could basically do the same thing.  Limestone will not hold on steeper than a 20% grade.  In this case you want to definitely use concrete or asphalt.  Also, have you thought about using landings for the driveway to reduce the steepness at the garage and at the shoulder of the street?  Its a good idea.<SEP>How do you build/install a crushed limestone driveway up a hill? We have already graded the dirt road?<EOS>
