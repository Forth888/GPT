Go to a Car stereo shop.  The reason you would go there is because sound dampening is part of high end car audio systems.  The last thing you want is road noise on your expensive car audio system.There are items you can buy such as spray on material, adhesive pads, and non-adhesive fabric type material.  Dynamat is the big popular provider of sound dampening materials, but there are online places like partsexpress.com which will sell you cheaper no-name dampening material.  Just look it up in their car-audio section.You will likely find that decreasing the noise is gonna cost you a good chunk of change and a lot of work.  Usually you need to 'dampen' (add sound deadening material) the doors and floor.  You can also do the roof if that is the main source of your problem.  If you are a DIY'er it can all be done for a few hundred dollars assuming you are comfortable with disassemblign your cars interior parts.  I would let a pro do this as there is too much potential to break panels and improperly install the materials.<SEP>How can I make my car interior less noisy?

Front Wheel Bearing and Hub ReplacementTools RequiredJ 42129 Wheel Hub Remover (this is a fairly generic tool you can rent from some parts stores - you may or may not need this tool - you won't know for sure until you remove the hub nut as outlined below)Removal ProcedureRaise and support the vehicle.Remove the tire and wheel.Disconnect the wheel speed sensor electrical connector (2), if equipped.  Remove the wheel speed sensor electrical connector from the bracket, if equipped. Remove the front wheel drive shaft nut. Insert a drift or flat-bladed tool into the caliper and rotor to prevent from turning. Remove the brake rotor. (Removing the dront driveshaft nut is going to be the hardest part of the repair.  It is a large nut - 36mm if I remember correctly - and torqued to over 140 ft lbs) Use 3 wheel nuts in order to attach the J 42129 to the wheel bearing/hub.Use the J 42129 in order to push the wheel drive shaft out of the wheel bearing/hub. (often times the drive shaft will push out of the hub with only hand pressure - the older and more rust on it, the more likely you are to need the tool to overcome the rust) Remove and DISCARD the wheel bearing/hub bolts. Remove the J 42129 from the hub. Important: Ensure that the wheel drive shaft outer seal/boot is not damaged. Remove the wheel bearing/hub and splash shield-noting the position of the shield for re-installation. Installation ProcedureInstall the wheel bearing/hub with the splash shield as noted during removal.Caution: These fasteners MUST be replaced with new fasteners anytime they become loose or are removed. Failure to replace these fasteners after they become loose or are removed may cause loss of vehicle control and personal injury.Install NEW wheel bearing/hub bolts. Tighten Tighten the NEW wheel bearing/hub bolts to 130 N·m (96 lb ft).Install the brake rotor and caliper.Install the front wheel drive shaft nut. Insert a drift on a flat-bladed tool into caliper and rotor to prevent the rotor from turning. Tighten Tighten the front wheel drive shaft nut to 160 N·m (118 lb ft).Important: Ensure that the connector clip engages the bracket properly. Install the wheel speed sensor electrical connector to the bracket, if equipped.  Connect the wheel speed sensor electrical connector (2), if equipped. Install the tire and Lower the vehicle.

Just like you would break in any camshaft. Follow the instructions included, as they are made by guys who get paid lots of money to figure stuff like that out.That said, Make sure you use plenty of asembly lube, and make sure the valvetrain is adjusted. Start the motor and make sure the oil Pressure comes up to speed... probably wouldnt be a bad idea to pressurize the oilsystem before start up. Once the oil pressue is up, go for a drive, and do your best to not stay at a constant speed. Accelerate and decelerate. DONT RACE THE MOTOR!!!!

NO!Dear god no, use gas! If you don't use gas you'll break it if the seal is very old and solid. Believe me I know here, I deal in irreplaceable glass all of the time. If I were to break it, there is no going to the glass shop and getting another!The sealer is a rubber, and rubber breaks down with petrol. It takes some time, maybe even a whole day if it's totally solid, but man it helps, helps a lot. Makes the sealer gooey again. Just get a squirt bottle and keep squirting the seals with fuel and keep it wet for as long as possible. You can feel with your fingernail that it's starting to get softer. Best thing about it is, it has zero effect on the inner safety lining of the glass. I've used this method on 1930's vehicles with the original glass and didn't even harm them.My 1953 Bel Air actually has it in the car manual, to remove the glass use gas.

If you are working with concrete you may want to start at the top of the hill and work downward.  This way gravity helps you pull the concrete into place.  If you had the limestone delivered in a concrete mixer, called pugging, then you could basically do the same thing.  Limestone will not hold on steeper than a 20% grade.

Over 20 years experience.www.lowratesappliancerepair.comHOW TO CLEAN AND REPAIR A KITCHEN RANGE HOOD:A range hood that doesn't adequately remove smoke and smells from your kitchen is usually suffering from one of a few common problems: The grease filter or some part of the exhaust ductwork may be clogged, or the fan may be bad. Neither of these repairs should take you much time.Overall Things You'll Need:Plumber's Snake Ammonia Soap Replacement Fan Screwdriver, or nut driver and socket Old Toothbrush Heavy Rag Plastic Pan Unclogging the exhaust system:Instructions: STEP 1: Remove the grease filter by sliding it out of its clips.STEP 2: Submerge the filter in a plastic pan filled with hot, soapy water and 1/2 cup (4 fl oz/125 ml) ammonia. Let it soak for at least 15 minutes. If it's still dirty, soak it again, then rinse it thoroughly and set it aside to dry.STEP 3: Remove the exhaust fan. Unplug the fan, then use a screwdriver or a nut driver and socket to take out the screws that attach it to the hood.STEP 4: Clean the fan blades with an old toothbrush dipped into the ammonia-water mixture (see Warning).STEP 5: Clean the inside of the exhaust ductwork, using a plumber's snake with a heavy rag tied around the end. Push the snake through the ductwork. Soak the rag in the ammonia and water mixture, then run it through the ductwork. Rinse out the rag and repeat the operation until the duct appears to be clean.STEP 6: Clean the exhaust hood that's attached to the outside of your house. Use the old toothbrush and the ammonia-water mixture to loosen the grit and grime around the flapper plate. Make sure the plate moves freely when you're done. If it sticks closed, it can prevent the exhaust hood from working.STEP 7: Reinstall the grease filter. REPLACING THE FAN MOTOR:Instructions: STEP 1: Remove the grease filter by sliding it out of its clips.STEP 2: Turn on the fan and inspect the motor. It needs to be replaced if it hums rather than turns, turns very slowly, runs for a short time then stalls, or feels very hot and won't turn.STEP 3: Disconnect and remove the fan, following step 3, above.STEP 4: Take the fan to an appliance store to get an exact replacement.STEP 5: Install the new fan. OVERALL TIPS AND WARNINGS:Never put a grease filter in your dishwasher to clean it. You could end up with a film of hard-to-remove grease on the dishwasher walls. Clean your grease filter monthly. It's your first line of defense against grease and grime that can damage the fan motor and plug the ductwork. When cleaning the blades on the exhaust fan, take care not to wet the motor. The water could short-circuit the motor when you reinstall it.<SEP>How do you find/install a replacement over-stove kitchen exhaust fan? Are is making funny noises and dying.

When inspecting the belt, if it appears to be glazed (shiny), show cuts, cracks or other deterioration on either side or on the edges, has chunks missing from it, or is merely noisy—it has to be changed. It's helpful if you can determine the cause of a particular problem—from normal wear to damage—so you can be assured that the replacement belt will last the full duration of its service life.   Before taking off the belt, check your service manual for any helpful tips that apply to your specific vehicle. One caution: as belt tensioners are sprung very tightly (some tighter than others), any "slips" involving the wrench used to loosen belt tension can cause serious personal injury, as well as damage to the surrounding area under the hood. Ideally you should use the special service tool designed for belt-tension removal (via the tensioner). Be aware of where the tool will be positioned when tension is removed and make sure the tensioner is resting on its internal "stop." Obviously, if the tool contacts another component before the tensioner stop is contacted, tension is not completely released and the tool will "jam" if left to rest in that position. The possibility of the tool slipping off of the tensioner is high, and injury will likely result. Once tension is properly released, it's time to remove the belt. Start removal from the most easily accessed and largest pulley having the least amount of belt contact, if possible (sometimes this is the tensioner, sometimes not). Usually, it's just a matter of pulling the belt clear of the other pulleys and right out of the engine bay. However, sometimes engine mounts or other components such as splash shields first need to be removed. Once the belt is out, here are a few other components to inspect: > Coolant pump for leakage (will cause belt noise if coolant gets on belt) or bad bearing > Fan Clutch (if equipped) for fluid leakage > Fan for damage (especially a problem with plastic fans) > Tensioner unit for noisy pulley bearing or wear on tensioner mechanism > Idler pulley(s) for noisy bearing or irregularly worn belt contact area (especially a problem on plastic pulleys) > Any under hood component that is making contact with or is close to the belt, tensioner, or any pulleys > Any other source of fluid leakage onto the belt With all of that correct, the belt can now be installed. Since all replacement belts are not created equal, get the best quality belt possible. The same cautions highlighted earlier should be observed on reinstallation. Be patient. Route the belt in reverse order of removal, keeping especially vigilant about making sure that the belt ribs are set correctly in the pulley grooves, and the back of the belt is squarely contacting the tensioner and idler pulley(s), before starting the engine. If applicable, note the tensioner position "scale" (its arrow should be somewhere between the two lines on the other half of the tensioner, preferably on the "tight" side). If it's way off, the belt may be incorrect. phew...hope that helps.<SEP>how do I change the serpentine belt on my 01 dodge intrepid?<EOS>

If your main bearings are worn out most likely the other bearings and parts in the engine are worn as well.

By using professions who are equipped to handle the above questions are usually followed up with further treatments of the infested areas.If you should decide to take on the task yourself your first task would be to find the Food and Water source of your particular pest.Bait or trap would be the solution to irradication,keep in mind the safety of any pets you may have or children that could access the treated area.I work a ranch and I have to deal with pest invading the feed bins for my horses.Elimination of the food source will be your first move..give a couple days to see if you had any further visits(droppings,fresh foot prints, etc.)If you have, then the proper bait (Poison)can and should be purchased at your local Feed store that caters directly with issues concerning Ranch and Farm Pest and can help you in your choice as to which brand to use.Most of the poisons used are strycnine(sp)based to prevent odor from dead pest.Also if you choose to go the poison route Please keep any pets that you might have (dogs,cats)its not uncommon for dogs to eat dead rats or mice...and before you use baits such as this Please also consider the Natural rat traps that hunt these vermin(owls,Hawks,Eagles)keep check on the areas baited,and look for obvious signs of area use by the pest and proceed accordingly by either application of more poison or the removal of it if your problem has subsided.I quit the poison end of my problem as it worked okay, but it didn't eliminate it...I finally decided to get a couple of cats ...trading 1 pest for another, because cats can and do become a problem also if not kept in check.Its not the cats fault, but the people who owned them and no longer want the responsibility of them, and simply take them for a ride to the country and drop them off..Cats are domestic animals and are not like there counterparts that survive by the hunt.If you live in city,Cats would probably be your best ally, have them 'fixed'and give them love and food, a warm place to sleep, and they will address the rats,Once rats get the message a new 'Sheriff' is in town they soon vacate. I hope this helps and good luck!<SEP>How do I find a reliable exterminator who won't overcharge me? I have been invaded by rats.  My home methods have not worked so well.

Mice thrive where food is plentiful and harborage is present. Any steps that reduce these two requirements willdiscourage their numbers.Good housekeeping is imperative. The eliminationof hiding places is particularly important, andholes in walls, floors, or foundations must be sealed off or screened over to prevent new infestations.Migrations from adjoining fields often occur with thecoming of cold weather in the fall of the year.Mice can squeeze through holes over ¼ inch indiameter, so it is important that foundations, doors,and windows be frequently inspected and smallopenings closed.Light infestations of mice can be removed throughthe use of several ordinary snap traps.Poisoned baits will reduce heavy infestations of housemice.<SEP>how to prevent mice from coming in the house?<EOS>

Remove the plastic cover around the steering column, you'll see the switch on the right side. There are a few Torx screws that hold it to the column, they may be the tamper proof Torx screws. Unplug the long flat connector from the bottom of the switch and the small connector if there is one. To remove the ignition cylinder, insert the key and turn it to the run position, there is a roll pin on the bottom that must be pushed in, in order to remove the cylinder. Hold your mouth open just right and jiggle the cylinder out of the switch while pulling on it.<SEP>how do you change the ignition switch on a 95 jeep cherokee?<EOS>

No clever tricks here. You'll have to remove the roof covering (shingles) by pulling the nails carefully under the exposed part of the shingle. Get a nail bar for this. Remove enough shingles to expose what sheathing needs replacing plus a bit to give you "tool room". Cut out the bad sheathing using a circular saw set to just a tad deeper than the thickness of the sheathing. Cut out the bad stuff as squarely as you can splitting the cut on a rafter so that you have a nailing surface on each end. Replace the sheathing to match, replace the shingles putting a dab of roof cement over each nail and paint everything to match. You may need to replace underlayment and drip edge as well. Work carefully, measure twice, cut once, don't cut nails with your new saw blade, visualize what you want to do and think before you act. The hardest part will be removing and re-installing the shingles. Don't pound on exposed surfaces of the shingles. Keep everything square.Thanks to nailpounder and samhbane :)<SEP>how to repair roof sheathing? The front left corner of the roof has the edges of the sheathing damaged.

When replacing brakes.  The front rotors (disks) are held in place by the calipers. There are 2 bolts that hold the calipers to the mounting plate. Typically allen head (hex)or torx (star) fasteners are used to secure the calipers.The mounting plate is held on by two bolts. (17-19 mm)1st jack the car up, place on stands, then chock the rear wheels. leave the steering wheel unlocked by placing the keyto the unlock position, but not in the on position.Turn the wheels so the inboard rear is accessible to the side you will start on. Remove the wheels. remove the caliper bolts, lift straight up on the caliper, and the brake pads can be slid out of the mounting plate. Remove the mounting plate, and the rotor will slide off.  if the rotor does not move. tap it gently with a rubber mallot.Remove the master cylinder cap (where the brake fluid is filled)) Get a "C" clamp that screws shut by turning it (any auto parts store will have one) Put an old brake pad against  the caliper piston (metal side against the piston)and compress the piston into the caliper until the metal part of the pad is flush with the caliper.The rotors can be taken to an auto parts store (I recommend Napa) They will measure the thickness of your rotors, and will tell you if they need to be replaced.  If not, they will resurface the rotors. When reinstalling.  first the rotor, then the mounting plate. Slide the brake pads on, along with any anti rattle clips or springs, that were on the car. Then the the compressed caliper. (if the calipers dont fit back on, you will need to compress a little more)  Same for both sides.Put the master cylinder cap back on, and pump the brake pedal until it becomes firm, and hard.  Check the brake fluid level, and ensure all fasteners are tight.Replace the wheels, tighten all lugnuts, put the car back on its wheels.  Test brakes in the driveway, and make certain they are stopping properly.  Good luck<SEP>How to change your car breaks,what if the disc is bad too? My car is Daewoo Leganza 2000.<EOS>

What are the symptoms?  You might just need to clean your bulb sockets.  It also depends on whether you have brake lights that operate as turn signals also or if it has completely separate turn signals.  You could just have bad bulbs.  I've seen all the bulbs go bad before anyone noticed!Some common symptoms on systems with brake and turn signals on the same bulbs:Tail light works OK but goes out when brakes are applied. Tail light will blink dimly when turn signal is used.This is a bad ground.  It could be a dirty bulb socket, or a loose ground wire.  The socket can be cleaned with a piece of sandpaper.  The ground wire will be located near the taillight assembly, bolted to the body.This system also runs the turn signals and brake lights through the turn signal switch.  A bad turn signal switch can mess up the brake lights and the turn signals.  The systems that use a separate brake light system have entirely separate circuits for brake, tail, and turn.  These systems typically have amber turn signals and red brake lights.The dirty socket or bad ground stuff still applies.If none of the lights work you probably have a wiring harness that has been damaged.<SEP>how do i fix the rear passengers tailight panel to make my tailights and brake light work?<EOS>

If you are hearing a siren sound instead of the horn honking, then you have an aftermarket alarm.  I'm guessing you don't have a key fob or you would have known you have an alarm, so it is possible that the previous owner installed an alarm and as most people do, lost the fobs and just never armed the alarm again.  When you changed the battery, it activated this aftermarket alarm.  Before I tell you ways to deactivate an aftermarket alarm, let me tell you about the factory alarm in your Cavalier.  Your Cavalier is equipped with the chevy passlock system.  In brief, there is an optical sensor in your ignition that recognizes the cut of your key to prevent theft.  There is an "Anti Theft" indicator light in your instrument cluster - this is why you think you have a factory alarm.  This light only indicates that you have the passlock system.There are a few ways to turn off an aftermarket alarm.  Without the key fob, all you can do is to put it into "valet mode" which is kind of like putting the system in hibernation.  First, disconnect your battery again, put the key in the ignition, turn the key forward to the on position (past the position where you can listen to the radio, and before all the way where your car would start cranking) and re-connect the battery.  If there is no siren, then turn the key forward and start the car.  Look for a red LED light somewhere on your dash to stay lit (not blinking).  It is now in valet mode and your car is as it was before you changed the battery before.  If this doesn't work,  some of the older aftermarket alarms can be disabled by turning the key to the on position and back to off and repeat for a total of three times. (with the battery connected) If both of those don't work you will need to find either a silver toggle switch or a small round black button - normally mounted somewhere under the dash around where your left foot would go.  Try to leave your finger on the button and turn the ignition forward to on, or with the ignition forward push the button (or flip the toggle switch).  As with the first method, you will know you have succeeded when the red LED stays on without blinking. Good luck.Once you have the car in valet mode, take the car to a stereo shop and have the alarm removed (unless you don't mind repeating the above whenever your battery dies or gets replaced).  Most shops will only charge you 1 hour labor to remove the alarm.<SEP>How do i Disable the factory Anti-theft system in my 99 cavalier.

First,since you rent,there may be a clause in your rental agreement that does not allow for these appliances in your apartment.This can be solved by simply asking the landlord of the apartment complex.If this is the case,the point is mute.If this is not the case then have them do the work or have it done by an electrician. The reason I say this is that installing a 220V outlet for a dryer most likely involves more work than you want to do yourself....cutting into the wall,getting wire in the wall,wiring the outlet and the breaker panel,installing a dedicated breaker,repairing the wall,and don't forget the dryer has to be vented,etc..If you are allowed to have a dryer in the apartment,you might try finding a 110V portable unit that you can simply plug into an existing outlet.Hope this helps.<SEP>How do I hook up ap an electric dryer??

How can I import a large list of tasks into Trello<SEP>I wrote a bookmarklet to help with this task.  It's very crude and it works for me today, but I've only tested it briefly and only in Chrome.  It calls some JavaScript functions in Trello directly so it's extremely likely that it will break when they update the site.  Hopefully it works for you, but please don't use it if your data is critical in case it mangles it.  If you want to try it out, you can get the code from here .  There's both a readable version, and a version suitable for copying into a bookmarklet.  To use:   Go here , select the entire contents ("javascript:..." to "...%29%28%29%3B") and copy to the clipboard.  Create a new bookmark, call it something like "Trello - Add Many" and paste the contents from step 1 into the URL field for the bookmark.  Go to the Trello board you want to add items to and click the bookmark.  An overlay should appear that will let you select the list you want to add cards to, and enter a number of new card titles -- one per line.  The overlay will disappear when you hit "Submit".  If you want to get rid of the overlay without adding any new cards then just refresh the page.   Note: If you're trying to get your tasks out of Google Tasks and into Trello then choose Actions - Print task list in Google Tasks, copy the tasks from the printable view, and paste into the bookmarklet's entry box.<EOS>

I tried everything from Critter repellant, to Gopher poison to using a trap.. (they got smart, they don't fall for trap anymore).  I even used smoke bomb to smoke them out, but since it is underneath my deck, smoke just dissipates.. Anybody with suggestions??<EOS>
Hey, this is just my type of question.  I am called the Princess of Plumbing in my town and my suggestion to callers when they call in with this situation is to get a pail of water and pour it down each floor drain.  Water evaporates from the traps and that allows sewer gases to escape so if you put more water into the floor drain traps the gases cannot come up.  Try this before you hire a plumber.<SEP>HOw do I get rid of a Sewer smell that comes after the upstairs toilet is flushed.? I get a smell when the toilet upstairs is flushed but also if someone lets the toilet run downstairs I will get the smell too. My house was built in the 60's.

Many different places sell the actual hitch and some also install them.  First you need to determine what Class you need.  There are two different Classes available for your Year and Make of Vehicle.  The Class II Hitch has a Weight Carrying Capacity of 3500 lbs and the Class III/IV Hitch has a Weight Carrying Capacity of 5000 lbs.  How much weight you will be pulling with the hitch determines which you will need.  There are many tricks involved in installing the hitch also. (i.e., do you need a power module, wiring, brackets, etc.)  Your best bet would be to find a local resaler of towing products, who also offers installation services.<SEP>how to install a hitch in isuzu trooper 1993?<EOS>
