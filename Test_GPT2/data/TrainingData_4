Pendulum clocks usually have a small nut (usually with ridges) right at the bottom of the pendulum. You use this to adjust the length of the pendulum. This adjusts the speed of the clock. Turn one way to slow it down and the other way to speed the clock up.Grasp the nut in you right hand between your thumb and forefinger with the thumb in front. Turn to the left to slow the clock down and to the right to speed it up.This is trial and error. Make small changes and wait for several hours to see the change. Sometimes it take days to get it right. I usually leave my adjustment with the clock running a little on the slow side because it is easier to correct the time by moving the minute hand forward than stopping a "fast" clock and waiting for time to catch up.Big caution. DO NOT TRY TURN THE MINUTE HAND BACK, you'll cause real damage!! <SEP> How do you regulate fast or slow on a key wind pendulum clock?

Is your engine a Vortec 4.3L It could be a lot of things.....If you have oil in your antifreeze and antifreeze in your oil, it is your head gasket.   If not,Start with the basics,  Replace the sparkplugs, cap and rotor, replace your airfilter and pcv valve, if you haven't already done so replace your O2 sensor.

You are entitled to use the contractor of your choice when dealing with an insurance claim.  Call a couple of reputable roofers and get an estimate before you sign any settlement with the insurance company.  Then you will know that the adjusters numbers are correct.By the way, the numbers you give mean that the roof of your house is 1,440 square feet.  This would be about right for a gabled roof ranch house of 1,248 square feet of living area (26'x48).

I work for a Natural Gas Company.  The advice we give people is to cut back your thermostat to about 65 degrees while you are up and around 60 degrees while you are sleeping.  Insulating your windows and doors also helps.  You can get that clear window plastic at Wal-Mart pretty cheap and it is very effective.  Make sure you don't have any drafts and if you do, stop them up with something.  Wearing sweatpants and sweatshirts while lounging around helps.  When you are cooking, cut back your thermostat too.  Your oven should warm up your house pretty well also. <SEP> How can I save on heating in an apartment? I am living in a two bedroom apartment in the midwest.

Duraglit, which is actually brass polish, is used throughout the trade to remove sticker prices from delicate china, glass and everyday objects. I do not see why is should not work on  a windscreen.

Just because the car's lights work doesn't necessarily mean the battery is fine.Does the car turn over? A starter motor (electrical) actually turns your engine when you are trying to start your car. If when you put the key in and try to start the car and you hear no sound at all, or maybe a click and then no sound, it would either be your starter motor has died and it needs to be replaced, or your battery can't give enough amps to the starter motor to start up the car.I would recommend doing this in this order.1. Check the fluid level in the battery. If the fluid is low in the battery fill with distilled water up to the necessary levels.2. Have someone try to jump start your car with a pair of jumper cables. Let the good engine run for a minute to try to place a charge in your battery. If your car starts up, then the battery is what was dying, or you were low on electrolyte (what the water you added to the battery becomes). Drive the car for about 10 minutes to charge up the battery. Don't use any accessories if possible (ie turn off radio/head lights and anything electrical). If you turn off your car and it starts back up, your done.If trying to jump start the car and it doesn't turn over or all you hear is a ping or click sound, then your starter motor is most likely the problem. You'll have to get the starter motor replaced. <SEP> how do you troubleshoot a 1996 sable that will not start? Battery seems to be working, has lights, radio etc. <EOS>

Yes there is a trick or several tricks.First with the em.brake off and the car in Neutral.Take off the tire,using a large hammer smack the drum in between the lug studs several times,this works 99% of the time.Then tap on the back of the drum,be sure not to hit the backing plate and bending it.put both hands on the drum across from each other moving side to side pulling on the drum.It should come off.You must have some brake tools to remove the shoes.You buy these tool at a car parts place where you buy the brake shoes.They can show you what you need.They are not that costly.A repair manual can also be of help and you can buy that there also.Do one side first leave the other side on in case you don't remember how the shoes go on.There is a primary shoe and a secondary shoe just compare them before you remove them.One shoe is longer than the other one.That is another reason not to take both sides off you can always go look at the other side.You should take both rear drums with you and have them turned at the auto parts place.Mark the drums L and R so they go back on the same side they came off of.If you do not have them turned you may experience a pulsation when braking when finished.Check for leaks (fluid)at the brake wheel cylinders,if you have one you must rebuild them or replace them.I would for sure get a repair book.You can get a Haynes or others that are cheap. <SEP> how to change rear brake shoes on a 1998 camry? i was not able to take the rear drum off...is there any trick to it...what are the steps in changing out the shoes? <EOS>

Currently you cannot add a subtitle/caption track to someone else's video.  However, you can prepare the caption/subtitle file for the video and then share it the author so they can add it to the video (it's simple and I don't think he or she would object since subtitles do not have to be turned on by default).

Mothballs placed around the outside of the house is suppost to repell them.Sodium lamps for porch and outdoor lighting is a great way to save on your energy bill and reduce the number of spiders that find their way into your home chasing the bugs that are attracted to normal "blue wave" lighting. Osage Hedgeballs, otherwise known as Hedgeapples or Sticky Balls (tee hee!) have been used as a natural spider repellent for a long time, but only in the last few years have they gained more mainstream popularity, even if there is no explanation for why they work. They can be found in the produce section of your local grocery store. If not, ask the manager to order them, they're very cheap and widely available.Remember, spiders like to eat other bugs. So, if you spray for other pests, you'll diminish the spiders' food supply and make your home a less inviting place to find a meal. <SEP> How can I keep spiders from coming into my apartment?

You really need a factory service manual for this.  The steering column is mounted to the vehicle at the factory as unit.  That means the wiper, signal lever is already installed on the steering column when it is put into the truck.  Depending on the make and model, it may be necessary to remove the entire steering column from the vehicle to disassemble the wiper, signal switches.  You may get lucky and have a cover or shroud on the column that will give you access to the connectors.  If you are having trouble with the switches on the lever itself, I believe the column has to come out.  Sorry it isn't a five minute job.....and please be careful with airbags!  Be sure to remove negative cable from the battery before attempting any electrical repairs.

Excessive noise is the first clue. If it is an automatic, push down the park brake and move the selector from reverse to drive and back a couple of times. If if have a jerking and noisy transition, could be the rear axle. Nothing takes the place of a good inspection of the drive line. Support the rear axle on stands, shift the trans to neutral, apply the park brake. Try to turn the drive shaft as you notice the universal joints. No excess? Try to move the drive shaft up and down and side to side at the u-joint. No excess? Pull the rear cover on the differential and see what's going on in there. These differentials are a 7.5 in ring gear and will not take a lot of abuse. A reasonable upgrade for them is a posi carrier from a 4x4 Blazer or Jimmy. The carrier must be with the same axle ratio you have. I.E., a 2 carrier for a 2.73 or a 3 carrier for a 3.73. Unless you get the ring and pinion with the carrier. Next up would be an aftermarket carrier and ring and pinion gears. Next would be a stronger aftermarket differential, if you are really going to thrash it. Deep pockets for this one.

In a car or are you talking about a residential water pump?For a residential water pump, you have to take like a gallon container full of water.  Get the pump all setup and ready to use.  Plug it in or fire it up (if its gas powered).  Take the suction tube and make a U out of it.  Pour the gallon of water into the U and then tilt the tube towards the pump, so the pump starts trying to suck in that water.

A battery does not produce energy. It stores electricity chemically in its cells. The Alternator produces electricity when your car is running to keep the battery charged for starting the car and to run the electrical devices of your car.

This measures the voltage of the battery to see if it maintains good voltage under a large amperage electrical load. <SEP> How does a car battery actually produces electricity.

Use an everyday spray bottle and spray water on the popcorn.  Start in a small section in the most hidden corner of the room becasue there is a slight learning curve to this.  Once you spray and saturate the popcorn, use a putty knife (1" in detail areas, up to 6" in large areas) and attempt to scrape off the popcorn.  DO NOT OVERWET OR OVERSCRAPE AT FIRST! Start with minimal water and scraping and increase from there.  The goal is to scrape off the texture (popcorn) and not the drywall paper (if it is in fact drywall behind it, some older homes may have a different backing than drywall). Make sure you wear eye protection and something to prevent you from inhaling the dust and/or particles.  This is a VERY messy process, so make sure you cover everything below with a heavy plastic drop-cloth, which can be purchased at any home improvement store. <SEP> how to remove popcorn ceiling? <EOS>

One thing you should check before you take your car in for an allignment is the tire pressures... A low tire (front or rear) can make your car's steering pull in the direction of the low tire. Check your car owners manual for proper inflation pressures. If that doesn't help, then you need the services of a professional.Adjusting the front end allignment on your car is not a job for a home mechanic.  It requires some rather expensive equipment and technical knowledge to do the job right.  Your local Ford dealer or most area tire shops have the equipment to do the job. I'd suggest taking your car to one of them. <SEP> How do you adjust the alinement on your front wheels of your car? I have a 2000 ford focus LX and it pulls to the left. <EOS>
The clutch will slip, much like an automatic transmission vehicle. The revs will go up but your car won't go anywhere. These clutches are self adjusting, so once it starts to slip, it's time for a new clutch. "Something loose" is too broad to define. What does it sound like? Is it a chirping? Whining? Is it jerking/shuddering? What you're probably doing is slipping the clutch or double clutching. You'll get better at it, these clutches are durable.

Subsurface leak detection equipment.  U can't go by where the water shows up.  It seeks the past of least resistance & can show up 50' from the leak.  When I locate leaks I use an air compressor hooked to the boiler drain to the washer or the outside hosebib.  The air is easier to hear than water.  Sometimes if you put your ear to tha slab you can hear the air gurgling coming out of the pipe. You can also drill a 3/8" hole where you hear it best and when your over it the air will blow out of the hole pretty hard. I have equipment that makes this easy though.

1. Get the oxygen sensor you need from the parts counter of a Dodge/Chrysler dealership. Emissions problems can be really tough to track down, so for this you want to spend the extra money to get the real thing. Know engine size, transmission type, year, CA emissions or not, high altitude or not, etc. before you go to the dealership, since all these things might cause a different version of the sensor.2. Replace air filter and PCV valve before you put in the O2 sensor. PCV valve should be changed with every oil change. Fresh oil and filter are always a good thing. (Reason? Oil blowby contaminates O2 sensors.) I also replace fuel filter (never gets done) and check fuel pressure, since if these things are poor, the computer may misinterpret them as an O2 sensor. 3. Disconnect the battery. Not strictly necessary, but always good practice, especially since wrenches have a magical way of falling between the starter motor's positive lead and ground. It may also clear the ECM's RAM. 4. With exhaust system warm but not hot, use a combination or deep socket wrench to get off the old O2 sensor. I usually cut the leads off the old one first. Remember you cannot splice an O2 sensor's leads. Use a 6 point socket for better torque, the sensors have a habit of being corroded into place. 5. Apply the anti-seize compound which came with the new sensor. Thread it in by hand and then torque it to specification using an O2 sensor socket and a torque wrench. 6. Plug the new O2 sensor into the harness and reattach the wires to supporting clips. 7. Reattach battery and start up the truck. The truck may behave oddly for a few minutes as the computer re-learns that the feedback system is now working properly and re-enters optimal closed loop mode. (ie. Check Engine light goes out and computer stops throwing diagnostic errors.)8. Re-read fault codes in a week. There should be no new codes. Single-wire (non-heated) O2 sensors are usually cheap enough to get into the habit of changing them every 50,000mi or so - basically every set of tires. O2 sensors get slow in time as deposits cover them. Keep the engine in tune to keep deposits to a minimum. Tune-ups (plugs, leads, cap, rotor, etc.) and fresh O2 sensors will save you gas money. <SEP> How do I change the oxygen sensor in a Dodge Dakota? <EOS>
There are two typical non-utility sources:1. the ground around your house does not shed water away from the foundation.2. the groundwater table is high.I have found that most instances the problem is the first one.  Usually the least expensive method to be re-grading the yard to keep water away from the house.  Occasionally you may need to excavate to the foundation slab, and apply a good waterproofing such as an asphalt compound. Customarily, home builders throw trash, such as lunch litter and wood scraps, along the foundation walls before the backfill is placed.  In addition to natural settlement of the ground around a home, when the trash decays, or collapses, the ground settles further.  When gutters overflow, this area holds water which can easily get inside unless the walls were waterproofed to swimmingpool standards.I recommend pulling back the top 4-6" of soil from around the house by as much as 6 - 8 feet out.  Get some clay soil and place a wedge of it with the thickest part near the house. Pack the clay down good. Then re-grade the top soil back, and plant. the end result will be that the ground around the foundation is higher than the remainder of the yard.  It will also be important to have the yard graded to get positive drainage moving the rainwater further away. A Landscape Architect can help you with this.  Then be sure to get the down-spouts pointed away from the house. <SEP> how do i stop water from seeping into my basement? <EOS>
The rivet tool is used to install rivets.  To do so you must drill an appropriate sized hole in the pieces of metal to be joined.  The size of hole will depend on the rivets you are using and the package will most likely state the size hole.  You then simply insert the long pin end of the rivet into the riveter, then insert the short fatter end of the rivet into the pieces to be joined and squeeze the handle until the pin end breaks free.  The rivet works to hold the pieces together by expanding in the hole. <SEP> How do you use a hand riveter? <EOS>

If you can see the alternator high up on the engine somewhere rather than stuffed down where it's hard to get to, then it may be an easier job for you. If it's driven off the serpentine belt, insert a 1/2 inch drive breaker bar in the automatic belt tensioner and release the tension enough to slide the belt off the alternator pulley. Likewise, if the alternator is driven off a separate pulley, loosen the alternator mounting bolts, remembering how they go back on the engine when you remove the old alternator. The main B+ wire is thicker and goes to the battery, so disconnect the battery cables first before attempting to remove the alternator wires. The field wires will be on a removable plastic connector that has a tab that needs to be released before pulling it out of the alternator housing. <SEP> how to change alternator on 1994 grand caravan 3.3? <EOS>

Use a damp cloth before the stain. This is called "popping the grain" as it allows the stain to penetrate better, because the wood, like a sponge will be more apt to absorb it.

You need a basic understanding of the risks involved, but it's easy to do:There should be a bleed valve where the fuel line goes into the furnace...open it up, eventually fuel should start dripping out (put a small glass container under to catch).If you don't have a bleed valve, loosen the fuel line itself where it connects, fuel will start to leak out.Another alternative, if your furnace has a manual reset that will make it run for about a minute, and then shut off due to air the line, keep resetting until it keeps running.

Make sure the stat you purchase is made for your type of system. Many are built for various applications and may need to be programmed for your particular use. First, turn off power to your furnace to insure you do not fry your transformer. Then write down the connections to your old stat before disconnecting them. If you have enough wire, clip off the old ends and restrip the wires so they don't break off when tightening the terminal screws. Connect wires to the same terminals as the old stat. Usually (if you have A/C) the stat terminals will be marked r,w,g,y, and rc or common. There may be additional terminals for a stat that may also be for heat pump applications which would require wiring for a reversing valve. Attach the back plate (subbase) to the wall with appropriate anchors and use a small level before tightening the mounting screws in their slotted holes then simply connect the wires and plug the stat to the backplate. Turn the power back on and you are set to program.There are many different digital stats available. If you know someone in the HVAC business, for about 100 dollars Lennox and Honeywell both make excellent models with simple user interface which you can program from your easy chair then plug to the subbase.Whatever time program settings you use, give 1/2 hour lead time for temp change and do not program night setback more than 8 degrees. It takes more energy to reheat or recool the average home 10 degrees than you would save in energy by setting back. I also reccomend leaving the fan in always on mode when you can. This stops air stratification (uneven temps from flooor to ceiling) and provides maximum filtration. The models I mentioned have a 30% fan on setting to save energy and give better air filtration.If you live in a cold climate a good addition to your system is a duct mounted humidifier. Not only does it alleviate dry air problems such as static, and sinus dryness, you can heat at a lower temperature and still feel comfortableInstalling a new stat is not as difficult as it may sound, I'm sure you can do it, good luck. <SEP> How to replace a thermostat?

i had a 1990 240sx with the same problem when i bought it, look under the hood where the throttle cable attaches to the throttle body, there should be another cable that looks like the throttle cable, mine had come loose.  just put it back in the little slot in the toggle and that should fix it. <SEP> How do you fix the cruise control on a 1991 240SX? <EOS>
The A/C compressor is going to have to come off to make this really easy.  Once it is off, there should be a bolt in the center of the pulley assembly that will have to be removed.  Afterwards, you will need a "pulley puller", and some penetrating oil (WD40 works good).  It's a pretty straightforward operation, however I would def. make sure you have no refrigerant left in the system before taking the compressor off (though if the compressor is really easy to get to, you may not need to take it off of the vehicle).  Also, to get the best performance out of the a/c system, make sure you take it to a shop that will put a vaccuum on it before adding new refrigerant. <SEP> how do you fix a ac clutch in a 95 ford exploer? <EOS>
A GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interruptor) measures the amperage in a circuit that is being used by the load on the ungrounded (line or hot) conductor connected to it, and compares it to the amount returning on the grounded (neutral) conductor. If the imbalance is more than 5 milliamps (.005 of an amp), it causes the GFCI to trip off within 1/40th of a second. Note: A GFCI is not a circuit breaker, and does not protect against a short or overloaded condition. You can legally install one in a circuit without a grounding conductor (the bare or green wire in your box) but you must attach a sticker that says "no equipment ground" to the face plate. New GFCI's come with these stickers in the package. This will allow you to legally install one in an older house that does not have grounded wiring. Hope that helps. <SEP> How does a GFCI outlet work?  Does it require a ground? <EOS>

Muriatic acid. It's the same thing used by most concrete companies to clean their drums. Most drivers carry a diluted mixture to use on the jobs, and a stronger strength is used to clean concrete buildup along the top of the drums.When using a stronger solution, wear rubber gloves, apply the acid, and let it do it's thing.

The process for adding bibliographic data is   (Enter the references into the reference management of your choice.)  For every title you want to cite, insert the corresponding placeholder string into the Google Docs document. An example for such a placeholder would be {Baeza-Yates 1997 #3}. The reference management software will usually allow to copy the placeholder string for a chosen title to clipboard.  With all the placeholders entered into the document, export it as .rtf file.  Feed the .rtf file into the reference management software.

Installation is the reverse of the removal. You need to shut off the water inlet and unhook the water line. Then get rid of all the water in the toilet. Flush it, bail it and then sponge it out. Next if the tank is removable, take the tank off the back. Then unbolt the seat from the floor. When you get the toilet out of the way, you need to check the flange for deterioration. If it is rusted out or rotted, replace it and replace the wax seal. Then gently set the new toilet on the flange with the nuts through the base and carefully tighten them down. Not too tight, follow the directions that come with the flange/wax seal. Then install the tank if it is a separate piece and install a new water supply line to the toilet.

I don't know your specific vehicle, but most cars have screws that hold the instrument panel on. Find the ones that go over your instrument panel, and remove them; they may be covered by plastic molding, so be aggresive when looking for them. Remove the dash, or applicable parts, that would hold the instrument cluster in. If you're replacing the whole tach, them reach behind, and unplug all the wires that plug into it. Can be tricky, as some are held in place by the inlet they plug into. Then pull the whole instrument cluster out by working it around the steering wheel. Now, like I said, I don't know your specific vehicle, so if your tach is stand alone, then just take the tach out. However, if it's like the ones I take out, you're gonna have to take the whole instrument cluster out, find what's failing on your tach, and replace it with parts from a good tach. When I did it, it was a circuit card that I had to replace. I know that was very vague, but I hope it helped somewhat. ps The instrument panel is the part with the tach, speedomoter, fuel gauge, and all the lights.....usually. <SEP> how do i install a tachometer on a 1995 geo prism? <EOS>

A squeaky noise may indicate a loose fanbelt or a fanbelt encountering too much resistance.In this case the sound will be like: Whinnninnninnninnnn!!!If you have a serpentine belt (a belt that winds around engine components like a snake), you don't necessarily have to replace it. It may be just loose. Snug it up. There will be an adjusting bolt somewhere most likely near the alternator. Buy a Haynes manual for your car at an Autozone ($12.00). It will show you exactly where the bolt is if you can't find it.If you have one belt that wraps around the crankshaft pulley, the air conditioner compressor, and the alternator(a more simpler setup to the serpentine), there will be an adjusting bolt right in front of the alternator. Snug it up if the belt is loose.Does it happen when you are steering? Turn the car on and steer the wheel lock to lock. If you hear a whining sound, you need power steering fluid. Un cap the reservoir and fill it. The Haynes manual will show you where it is.Does the problem only occur when the AC is on? Switch it on and off with the engine running. It it comes and goes, and the belt is not loose, your AC compressor needs oil. Buy a can of R134a AC gas with compressor lubricant and inject it into the input port. The port looks like a tire valve at the top of one of your AC lines. Again, your Haynes manual and the directions with the R134a can will tell you the details.Good Luck!

Depending on the details...1.) Grab the head of the screw with a Vise Grips tool and use it to twist the screw out.2.) Use a saw or Dremel tool to cut a groove across the head of the screw and use a regular slotted screwdriver to take it out.3.) Invest in a screw remover tool, like an Easy Out- drill a small hole into the screw and drive a reverse threaded bit into it. As you keep tightening the reverse tool, it will turn the screw out.4.) Try a product like Screw Grab- a gritty material that makes screwdrivers or other tools fit the slot or hole in the head of the screw better.5.) If all else fails, just drill a hole about the size of the screw right into the screw and drill it away.

The halogen is made such that the actual lamp is inside the surrounding reflector. The lamp has two prongs portruding from the reflector that fit tightly into a "free" base, in that the base is not really secured to anything other than the lamp, and the lamp is typically held by the trim. This is a little different than landscape lighting where the base us usually secured to a  mount.Let them completely cool off, get the lamp out of the trim piece then work one side of the base up a little (nearest one of the two pins), then the opposite side, "wiggling" the lamp slowly out of the base. If it absolutely does not move, the flimsy little base may get bent up trying to force everything, these are easy to replace if they get totally wrecked and you can buy them at any electrical supply house. Once in awhile one or both of the pins break off in the hole, a good pair of needle nose pliers may get them out.If you end up replacing the base, use high temperature rated wire nuts to attach the new leads to the old leads. Make sure you do not use lamps with a wattage greater then the fixture is rated for, often 50 watts. There are soome 70 watt maximum and there are some trim pieces that will force a maximum of 35 watts, such as shower trims.

Hi Deb,Simple answer--Only way to externally identify a 440 Sixpack is to measure the counterweight thickness of the harmonic balancer....................Some spam about that,if ya wanna wade thru it >>>>A 440 Sixpack is maybe THE hardest engine to identify of all the American Hi performance engines"HP" is Hi Performance,,,and was simply stamped on enginesthat got "HP" parts bolted-in on the assembly line.No Difference in HP and HP2,none whatsoeverNo Number on the engine identifies them.Besides the 3-2bbl Intake Manifold,,there's only ONE external feature,,,and that's the Harmonic Balancer/Crankshaft Dampener thingie.Only Sixpacks had that particular dampener.Internally--the obvious & visible differences were Few also.*Pistons had 4 valve releifs in the dome,,,all other 440's had only 2*Connecting Rods-'69 part# 3462426 Casting #1851535Those were "standard 440 rods" but with extra inspection.("Magnaflux" Crack checking,I 'bleive.???)In '70 Rods were changed to Casting # 2951908These are actual "Sixpack Rods",,Sixpacks were the only engines that used them.They MIGHT be in some '69's*Camshaft Sprocket had a 3-bolt attatchment.All other 440's had One center bolt holding on the Cam Gear.Obviously,,in order to VERIFY any of those things means WRENCH WORK,,Remove Cylinder Heads,or Oil Pan,or Timing Cover.........................................................Identifying the Balancer is easiest.It has 2 distinguishing features:#1 It has the ol' Offset Bolt Pulley---One of the bolts which holds the Pulley to the Balancer is Offset,,so that the Pulley will only install in That certain position.(which makes NO difference anyway???)The Offset Bolt Hole is the one which is aligned with the Timing Mark on the Balancer.There's a LATER 440 Balancer that looks VERY SIMILAR,except it's got a LITTLE Thicker Counterweight & All the Bolt Holes are the same--pulley will install in any position.It can be "tricky" to the eye to tell the 440 balancer from the SIXPACK one.#2) Sixpack has the Thinnest of all the counterweights,,among Mopar's counterweighted balancers.The Weight is .20" Thick on a SixPack,,and its .25" on the one that "looks like a Sixpack"The Sixpack is a little over 3/16",The Other is a little over 1/4"That's a Small Difference,,,,.050" ,,about  1.25 mm or 1/16"Easiest way to measure it without taking the Pulley Off:Get a 3/16" and 1/4"  Drill Bit,,a Good Light,,,and crawl under the car.Try them in the gap between the Pulley and the Balancer."Eyeball" Each bit's thickness in comparrison to the Thickness of the COUNTERWIEGHT.(Using the Straight end/SmoothShank part of the Bit,,,right? :)It makes like a "feeler gauge",,and the Difference will be obvious to see if you get a good close look at the Balancer.Here's an Ugly Old picture to see the Counterweight.Sorry it's not nice,,,Pics are SCARCE.At least the Counterweight is Clear and Obvious.On the page,,the 1st pair of Rusty looking balancers---Notice the one on the LEFT looks even & symmetricalon it's face,,surrounding the bolt holes.The one on the RIGHT is "LIKE" the Sixpack's.It has the Eccentric,Crescent Shaped Counterweight on it's face,In that pic,,the Weight is a thin ring on the Bottom,and it's Thick/Wide at the top.I hope I explained that to make any sense,,it's pretty obvious to see.http://www.moparts.com/Tech/Archive/bb/22.htmlI'd suggest using the "drill bit thickness gauge"in an area where the Weight's Diameter is Larger,,,such as from about 9 O'clock to 3:00 in that Pic.It will be easier to See the Thickness at the shallower De <SEP> How do you identify a 6 pack 440 motor?

Wow, so many answers, so few correct.  It amazes me that so few people actually know how much air to put in there tires.  No disrespect to you, you are just asking the question.  The psi marked on the side of your tire is the max inflation that tire is rated at.  It should say something like "35 psi at 1300 lbs".  What this means is if your car weighs  5200 lbs you should run 35 psi according to the tire manufacturers specs.  If your car weighs 3500 lbs, 35 psi is to much to run.  There is actually a formula to use to calculate the proper inflation pressure if you are that critical about it.  My assumption is that you are not, you just want to know how much air to put in your tires.  If you check the id tag in your door jamb it will tell you how much your car weighs and how much air to put in the tires.  The only problem I have with this is that car manufactures tend to go on the low side with this because it gives you a smoother ride and may tend to prematurely wear out the tires but if it helps them sell cars they will tell you whatever they want.  It has already been said at least once, if you are just not sure, run them at 32 psi.  If you have a standard run of the mill car (any mid size or compact) this will be fine no matter what size tires you have.  I have a one ton truck with 10 ply tires on it, on the side of the tires it says "max inflation 80 psi at xxxx lbs".  (1800 or something)  Do I run 80 psi?  Heck no, I run them at 40 all day long.  If I am hauling a big load I jack them up to whatever I need to to handle the load.  I have a Durango with 31/10.50/15 6 ply's.  They say 50 psi max, I run them at 30, 35 if I am going on a long trip with luggage and such.  I have  a 70 Bug with 165/15's, I run them at 32 all the time.  I run my tire pressures according to my driving habits and comfort.  My Durango has some aftermarket suspension mods that already make it ride like a caddy so the softer tires make it even nicer.  I drive my bug pretty fast and where I live there are a lot of twisty roads and the higher pressure helps with the cornering and squeezes every bit of mileage out of the fuel.  The reason I tell you all of this is so you can see just how "uncritical" it really is.  Oh yeah, about the over inflation.  Your tires are most likely radials, they do look a little low on air all of the time, that is they way they are designed.  In the old days whey bias tires were the norm overinflation was a bad thing because of heat buildup.  You could actually blow a tire if it had to much air in it.  In radials that is pretty much out the window.  On average even on a hot day on hot asphalt you will gain only about 2-3 psi in your tires.  Not enough to worry about.  If your tires are overinflated by 5 psi it won't really hurt anything so don't lose sleep over it.  That is what radials are all about, they hold their form, they are made out of steel not nylon.  The two best pieces of advice I could give you would be this: always keep your tires evenly inflated and rotate them every 5000 miles.  I hope this lengthy answer has been helpful, I tried to be as informative as I possibly could without being too confusing. <SEP> How do I know how much air to put in car tires?

If you want to save your self $40 for the mechanic to tell you whats wrong go to Advance Auto Parts or NAPA or Auto Zone and borrow their OBD II computer and hook it up to your cars computer reader under the steering wheel and it will give you a code.

YOU CAN'T got to Wal-Mart and get what you need.  Your car is pre-1994 and has an R-12 refrigerent system.  It isn't compatible with the R-134A you can buy at the auto parts stores or Wal-Mart.  The fluid uses a different oil base that will immediately erode and kill your seals, rendering your compressor, condenser, and evaporator useless.Most shops still have access to R-12, but it's spendy because no car has been produced since 1994 that uses it.  You can convert over to R-134A, but it's not a job you'd want to tackle in your driveway, and if all the R-12 isn't evacuated properly, it can cause problems. <SEP> how do i recharge my a/c ina 92 camaro r/s? <EOS>

You should remove the terminals and clean them with a post cleaner. You have a choice of two types.  Wire type or hard metal, I like the wire type.  AutoZone sells a battery terminal spray that works fine.  Felt pads will also help to reduce corrosive builbup on the terminals.  Once the terminals are treated, you should still mpitor them and clean again when needed.

You may not need to adjust the switch but the transmission linkage itself. Put the car in neutral with the wheels blocked so it won't roll, on the transmission you will see the switch with the selector shaft going through it and the cable attached to the lever. The nut where the cable attaches is the adjustment, loosen it and allow the linkage to relax. Put the trans shifter against the neutral stop and tighten the nut carefully so you don't move the transmission  lever. Now check the adjustment by moving the shift lever in the car to make sure you aren't off by one detent position, if you are go back and do it again. Now start the car with your foot on the brake and see if you got it. If you have it right you will now be able to take it out of park without the key. Next, with the car shut off and in neutral again you can set the neutral safety switch using a small drill bit, when the trans is in neutral the little hole should allow you to insert the drill bit. You just loosen the bolts and turn the switch to adjust it so the bit goes in easily with no force then snug the bolts down and check it out. <SEP> How do you adjust the neutral safety switch on a 1993 buick skylark?

Little trick I found is to get a user's unique code/string from their profile page's source.  Here's how to do it:   Go to their user page and right-click -> "view page source".  Search for "vnd" and copy the code that you find (It should start with "UC").  Open one of the user's videos.  In the URL address, add the following to the end: "&list=" then paste the string you copied.  Final step is simply change the 2nd character of the code you pasted from a C to a U.

You'll probably have to replace the stem......turn the cold water supply off to the faucet.  I'm assumming this is for a lavatory so there should be a cutoff valve underneath.

I agree. Almost every widow unit made doesn't have any refrigerant taps to add refrigerant. Most causes of window units not working are usually dirty coils. Take the window unit out and take it apart and clean the condenser (outside) coil and the evaporator (inside) coil with a garden hose and sprayer. Wash the coils out the opposite way the airflow goes through the coil. Let it dry out good and also clean and/or replace the filter. Put the unit back in the widow and try it. 9 times out of 10 that usually fixes it. Dirty coils make the compressor and motor works  lot harder, and therefore they get hotter the harder they work. This can lead to burnt connections on the compressor, or burnt windings on the motors. If a motor or compressor is bad, it is far cheaper to replace the whole unit than to repair.

If you've had new brake pads fitted, they can squeak while they are bedding in -- especially if they are sintered metal pads. This is normal and don't worry about it; the squeal will go away pretty soon when the pads are fully bedded in. (With race cars, they bed in several sets of pads during practice, and then they use the bedded in sets during a race. Not because they're worried about squeal but because bedded pads give slightly better performance -- and also they will know if any are duds that might disintegrate under full braking load. It happens...)You can fit ceramic-compound pads if you want. This will reduce the squeal.If you haven't had the brakes done for a while and they're squeaking really loud, most likely you have pads worn down to the metal and they're rubbing on the disk rotors. This is very bad news, because you are ruining the rotors and they're expensive -- and also the car won't stop as well as it should (until, that is, the things overheat and weld the pads to the rotors). You can also crack and/or warp the rotors if your pads are shot. The pads help to absorb heat and if they're too thin, the rotors get too hot.Take a look and see if you've still got brake material on the pads. If not, get them changed pronto (and probably the rotors will need to be machined as well). Always change both sides (ie both wheels) at the same time, even if one side is more worn than the others. This will keep your car's braking in balance.If you still have pads, they and/or the rotors have probably 'glazed'. They can be cleaned with special spray you can buy from any good auto accessories shop. DO NOT use gasoline to clean brakes, okay? Use only specialized brake cleaner.Check out the problem pronto or you may have a wreck. Seriously. <SEP> How to stop 1997 grand voyager squeaky brakes? <EOS>

first the oil filter is on the passenger side of the motor you have to remove it from the top make sure when you replace the filter you fill it with at least a quart of oil"15w40" your choice of brands. after you complete this portion you move to the bottom of the truck if you look up you will see the oil pan at the rear of the pan is the drain plug, remove slowly so not to get oil all over you when the oil comes to a very slow drip replace the drain plug it only requires 25lbs. of torque so don't over tighten to much. now wipe up the old oil from the bottom of the oil pan and get back under the hood depending on the engine size you will need between 10-16 quarts start with 9 quarts start the truck and let the oil pressure come up look while it's still idling for leaks. let sit for about 1 min. pull the dipstick and check oil level add until it's full. the filter is very awkward to tighten but make sure it's tight.... <SEP> how do you change the oil on a 85' ford diesel pick up? where? and how <EOS>

The active ingredient in almost every Nail Polsih Remover is acetone, it has a very low vapor pressure and so it evaporates almost instantly from the surface to which it is applied.  A better solvent for this task is Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), it has a higher vapor pressure than the Acetone so it works on the Cyanoacrylate (super glue) for a longer period of time.  If the countertop that you spilled the CA (Cyanoacrylate) on is a solid surface countertop like Corian you might have problems since it is another acrylic resin that could be dissolved by the MEK.  For the sake of Saving possibly thousands of $'s, please, please, please test the MEK on an inconspicuos area first.  If it dissolves the countertop material, follow the other suggestion and degrade the CA by placing a terry cloth rag over the top of the spill and pouring hot (not boiling) water over it.  Water slowly breaks down the CA and the increased heat will accelerate the process. <SEP> How do I remove super glue from kitchen counter?

Bob Vila has a good guide:A standing seam metal roof can be fabricated on the jobsite in a few days--and last for the life of the homeMetal roofing's attributes are impressive. Durable and long lasting, a metal roof requires little maintenance, can be retrofitted over many existing roofing materials, is available in a wide range of colors and styles, and is fire resistant. Standing seam metal roofs, popular in areas diverse as the hot and humid South and frigid New England, have shed their industrial roots to become an architectural statement.A standing seam roof is constructed of many interlocking panels that run vertically from the roof's ridge (the top of the roof) to the eave. The interlocking seam where two panels join together is raised above the roof's flat surface, allowing water to run off without seeping between panels. <SEP> how do you install a standard seam roof?

Three basic ways 1. Sanding.  Chemical paint remover. 3 Heat gun.  Sanding is the most labor intensive and it can become quit tedious if the wood is detailed. Start with an 80 or 100 grit and work your way up to a 400 depending on how fine you want the finish to be.  Chemical is the easiest but most hazardous to you and the environment.  just follow the directions on the stripper you select.  A heat gun is the trickiest to use.  Inpatients can lead to scorching of the wood or worse a fire.  Go slow and do not over heat the work. <SEP> How do you remove spray paint from wood?

In a jetted tub you have no filter to clean. I would, however fill it and add about 2 cups of laundry bleach-- then circulate a few minutes and drain. About once a month is often enough to do it.

Backfiring is a quick way of telling through the carburetor.   Bring your timing mark to top dead center on the balance mark and check #1 wire to the disturber with the cap removed and check to see how the rotor lines up.  To reposition the distributer, remove the hold down bolt, pull the distribute part way up and rotate the rotor and shaft 180 degrees and dropped the distributer back in position, lock the retainer bolt down, secure the cap and go for a restart.  With the engine now running, check for correct settings. <SEP> How do I know if my car is 180 degress out of timing? the engine is a 283 from a  67 impala that has points in the distrib.. <EOS>

Remove the #1 spark plug on the drivers side in the front of motor.  With the distributor cap off bump the starter to determine which way the rotor turns.  Clean the timing marks and indicator on the harmonic balancer and timing chain cover.  Make a mark at 8 degrees BTC (before top dead center) or which ever the tag on the vehicle says to time it on.  It will be from 5-10 degrees BTC.  Make another mark on the balancer that is 0 degrees or (Top Dead Center) TDC.  While someone else bumps the starter over, cover the #1 plug hole with your thumb until it blows your finger off.  At this point you want to turn off the ignition switch and turn the engine (by hand) in whichever direction it takes to bring it to TDC or 0 degrees.  On the top of the intake you will find the firing order.  Make a note of this order, and check later on.  Your distributor should be pointing at or just before the number one plug wire on the cap.  This should be with the rotor pointing towards the front of the engine.  If it is out of place you need to remove the distributor, turn it to where its hitting the notch that is before the #1 on the cap.  Remember it wil go down more when it goes into the oil pump.  You can use a long screwdriver to turn the oil pump to where the distributor goes all the way down.  With it all the way down, you should be able to turn the distributor and make the rotor point some on both sides of the #1 on the cap.  If It does not do this, then you need to move to another slot until it will sweep both before and after the #1 on the cap.  This will align your vacuum chamber to where it doesn't hit something when you are done.  Turn the distributor till it is just a few degrees before the #1 on the cap, and the distributor is down all the way in the oil pump.  Put the hold down on, and tighten the bolt to where you can turn the distributor but with a little effort to do so.  Don't forget to put the gasket under the distributor or it will leak oil.  Now check the firing order in the direction the rotor turns.  Starting in the front of the engine toward the headlights on the drivers side, the #1 will be the first one.  The second one on that same side will be #3, and #5 and #7.  From front to back on the other side of the engine it will be #2, and #4, and #6, and #8.  After you have checked the firing order, you are now ready to start the engine.  Have something like a wet blanket or towel handy in case you are out a notch and it backfires through the carburetor, as this can make a fire.  If it doesn't start right away, you are in the wrong notch, and will have to remove the distributor and start over.  Remove the #1 plug, get it on the compression stroke, see if the rotor is point at or just before the #1 plug wire on the cap.  If you have it there then you are in the correct notch.  It is easy to get off one notch and this can be a pain to get right, but you should be able to fire the engine without grinding on it.  I should start right up, and run pretty good.  Now use a timing light when you get the engine warmed up to operating temperature and the idle speed at about 750-800 RPM.  Plug the vacuum hose that goes to the distributor, and adjust the timing to spec's, or about 8-10 degrees BTC.  Glad I could help.  Good Luck!!! <SEP> how to time a 73 pontiac 350? <EOS>

Go to any auto parts store. They will have rubbing compound and polishing compound in tins the same shape as Turtle Wax.

The supply of both fluids is separate from each other.  Check to see which supply needs topping up.

Several methods here depending on the size of the hole. Smaller holes can be patched with pre-mixed sheet rock mud. Sounds like youve got a bigger problem. If the hole is really big, cut the sheetrock so that the hole is rectangular. Cut, from a new piece of sheet rock you got from your favorite home improvement center, a "patch" that is approximately 1" bigger than the hole on all four sides. Use construction adhesive to glue the patch from the backside into the hole. You may need to hold this patch in place with sheetrock screws around the edges. When that's dry (give it some time!) cut another piece that just fits the hole, about an 1/8" smaller on all sides. Glue that over the backing you put in. Let that dry. Use sheetrock tape and mud to finish off the seams. Sand, texture and paint to match. This isn't a difficult project. You need a sharp knife, straight edge, some sheetrock, sheetrock mud, sheetrock tape, construction adhesive, sheetrock screws, screw driver, canned texture, sand paper, paint and a 4" - 6" putty knife. Let everything dry before moving on to the next step. <SEP> how do i repair a large hole in drywall?  what tools should i use? <EOS>
No need to turn off any water,,, At least not initially.   The "P" trap under the sink is the place to begin, and should be easy to remove,,,using care certainly. The pipe that is the curved one...   You may be able, with just a large lock jaw pliers, to unscrew the connections.   Once apart flush the P trap with a hose or scoop out as much as you can of any debris... OR buy another.   The P trap is designed not only to trap gases/odors that may intrude from drain lines, but also manages to collect most everything else that fits down the drain.   If there is something wedged,,IE: hair pins etc, use a wire coat hanger to force the object out.   When replacing wou should have at hand new washers/gaskets to put back when connecting. You might also purchase the thread tape to ensure a better seal. Carefully rethread the connectors to the threaded down drains, assuring a tight fit, but not extreme fit, and turn on the tap.Rev.

The oil pan is under the engine. Put the car up on jack stands and use wheel chocks.  When you get under the car, you will see the pan plug. Remove it and the old oil will drain out. Catch it in a drain pan. Remove the oil filter and replace it with a new one. Replace the oil plug and put in four quarts of motor oil. Start the engine and wait for the oil light to go out or the pressure gage to rise. Look under the car for any leaks. Stop the engine and top off the oil to the full mark on the dip stick. Remove jack stands and wheel chocks. Dispose of used oil as a hazardous waste. Some auto parts stores will take the used oil for disposal or recycling. When you get good at it, the whole operation should take about 15-20 minutes. <SEP> how can i locate the oil pan for my 99 Alero.

on the pipe thinggie is called the stem. past the stem is a nut you need a deep socket to undo this. this will take out the valve body assembley . at the end of the assembley there is a washer. you can buy new valve stems and washers at store. if the valve stem assembly is leaking replace it. while it is out look at the seat of the tap. the flat area of the tap inside the hole is it corroded? if it is start looking at getting a new tap set or something to recut your seat. as it will keep chewing up washers otherwise or see if they are replace able. if the tap set is moen then you might just have to pull the tap valve out and take to store and they will replace for free.(pull with vice grips and becareful not to slip and hurt  yourself) <SEP> How do I fix my leaky shower faucet?

Changing the camber and toe in your car, without a working knowledge of how it works is not a good idea. It will decrease the handling and braking of the car.

If you didn't get the locking nuts when you bought the car then I wouldn't worry very much about it.When you sell a car, the seller buys it "as is".  IF a person called you about the locking nuts, that would be ok for them to check, just in case you DID have them.  Otherwise, the only answer you need to tell them is that you DO NOT have the nuts.When you sell a car or anything else, ALWAYS put on the bill of sale  "Buyer accepts item AS IS".

First of all you will need a torques bit for the drain plug.  Then if you are lucky enough to have a spin on filter you just loosen the filter and put oil on gasket of new one.  remove the old filter spin new one on and tighten 1/4 to 1/2 turn.  And put plug back in and put 6 quarts of new oil in it.  But I have a feeling that since you are asking this question you probably have the canister style filter.  This can be easy or a night mare depending on how tight the filter housing was put on last time.  There is a 3/8 ratchet insert on the end of the oil filter housing but if at all possible I would use a wrench on the big nut instead because the ratchet is in the middle and the housing is aluminum and can be brittle.  Either way you loosen the cap on the filter housing and unscrew it until it comes of then the filter will be inside.  Be care full that the housing doesn't turn.  If overtightened last time the chance of the housing and not just the cap coming loose is imminent.  If the housing comes loose you are screwed especially if your are laying under your car to do it.  If you are lucky enough to get the cap off and not loosen the housing then  just take old filter out and push new one in.  Replace cap and then just like the spin on filter both engines take 6 quarts of oil. <SEP> How do I change the oil on a 97 Cadillac Catera? <EOS>

Once you get the lower seat out then all you have to do is unbolt the bolts at the bottom of the back portion of the seat and then pop it up off of the hook latches. be careful not to bend or force any of these parts or they may bend and be forever twisted. <SEP> How do I remove the rear seats & access under rear dash in a 2000 Mercury Sable.

Have searched for many of those leaks. Intex has a bad "seaming" procedure. Never been able to find the leak, no matter how slowly and carefully I looked. Doubt if it could be repaired anyway, even if you could find it. You'd have to patch it from the outside and the air pressure would tend to blow the patch off. Take it down and return it to the place of purchase. I know one family that traded in three of the things and ALL had air leaks in the top rings! NOT a good recommendation, is it? <SEP> how can i find a leak in my air ring (top of my Intex swim pool? <EOS>

Scratches are difficult to remove. Most kitchen appliances, sinks, and counters have a polished finish with short directional polishing lines. Restoring a polished finish to its original appearance requires a professional such as a company that specializes in fabricating or polishing stainless steel. If the refrigerator or dishwasher door panel is replaceable, purchasing a new panel is normally more cost effective than professional refinishing. The homeowner may want to consider obtaining replacement panels with angel hair, distressed, swirl, or embossed finish. These finishes help to hide light scratching and can be obtained from companies that specialize in stainless steel finishes.Counters and appliance doors that are not easily removable must be refinished in place. When the counter is refinished, it may have long rather than short polishing lines. If a slightly different finish is acceptable and cost is a consideration, a homeowner can refinish the counter or appliance using a non-metallic abrasive pad such as a Scotch Brite® pad. This can be done by rubbing the surface with the pad using long uniform strokes in the same direction as the current polishing lines. This will not eliminate deep scratches. A professional may offer this finish as a less expensive option. The resulting finish is normally referred to as a hairline or long grain finish. Some appliance companies are starting to offer this finish. <SEP> How do you remove scratches from stainless steel refrigerator doors? <EOS>

As for how to powerwash....Just use your powerwasher on the deck. The high-powered stream should remove all the old stain and dirt that has been acummulating on it. You'll notice the difference immediately once you start.The difference between staining a deck and sealing it is simple. Staining refers to changing the appearance, or color, of the wood. You can use a darker stain to have the deck look like cherry wood or go with a lighter stain to have it look like oak, or cedar. Stain isn't necessary, it just helps to improve the look of the deck.Sealing involves puting a chemical coating on the wood to protect it from the elements, specifically water and moisture. It's a very important part of the upkeep for a deck.As far as what you should do with your deck? That's for you to decide. I would think the sealing is mandatory, but the staining is optional. You'll have to decide if you like the way the deck currently looks, or if you would like to change the wood's finish. <SEP> How do you clean a deck with a powerwasher?

Park the car and look at it from a distance directly in front and directly behind. If the front left corner is higher or lower than the front right corner, or if the back left corner is higher or lower than the back right corner, it may be time for a new suspension.Remember to take uneven loads out of the car first (no heavy boxes in the passenger seat), and remember that most roads slope slightly toward the curb, so a difference of an inch or two is probably ok.Other ways: If, when you drive over a bad road or railroad tracks or other rough terrain, the car should not "bottom out" (you'll feel it) on its suspension if the car is not excessively loaded.Also, a bad suspension may cause the tires to move out of alignment, and they might start developing unusual tread wear patterns (all wear on the inside half or outside half of the tire, for example), and you'll be able to see it. There are other things that can cause this so this does not automatically point to the suspension. <SEP> How can you tell if you need new shocks or struts? <EOS>

Materials & Tools:Knife, 6 or 8 drywall screws or other flat headed (countersunk) screws, screw driver, 2 wooden paint stirrers or a wooden yardstick, duct tape, simple white glue,  some spackling or drywall compound, putty knife (or spatula), sandpaper, 6 pack of beer, paint, a framed mirror, picture, or print.if the broken dry wall is still in place or punched into the wall cavity, carefully remove it. Cut out the broken material carefully - trying to keep it in one piece or attached to the backing paper -  and save it. You're going to reuse it.Get a couple of wooden strips or thin boards that are long enough to cross the hole. Wooden paint stirrers (free) or wooden yard stick cut down to size will work. so would a wooden ruler.place one of the sticks into the wall cavity so that it traverses the hole. Hold it up against the back side of the existing wallboard and secure it with a screw on each end. You're screwing through the wall and into the wooden strip behind the wall. Repeat with the other strip so you have  2 strips crossing the hole. This is the structure to which you will attach the broken piece. If the hole is small enough or the wooden strip wide enough - only one may be required.put the broken pieces of wall on the floor FACE DOWN and assemble them in their orignial configuration like a puzzle. Use the Duct Tape to hold them together if necessary. Flip the assembly over, and glue any partial pieces on to fill in any holes, trying to achieve a relatively flat wall surface.put the reassembled wall section into the hole, securing it to the strips with either a couple of screws, or glue if the wall section is too broken up to get a screw into. all the screws should be screwed in far enough to leave a little indention. sparingly smooth on the spackling or drywall compound with a putty knife (or spatula), just filling in the cracks and the screw holes. Try to preserve as much of the original wall texture as possible - it's hard to replicate.If you don't have spakling or joint compound, use the white glue. to fill in indentions (like those made by the screws, don't try to fill it in all at once. do one layer, drink a beer while it drys, then repeat.don't worry about glue not drying flat. Sand off the excess joint compound or glue to get a flat surface.Paint and hang a picture over it.

Rear brakes can be a pain, especially if they're drum brakes and not disc.  First thing to do would be to go out and get a Hayne's Manual for your car and it's year.  This book will cover the brakes specifically for your car, and will include pictures, step by step, and the reassembly.  They also make a Brake Manual that covers all kinds of brakes.  It's a little more detaild and includes even more pictures.  Both books can be found at any auto parts store and are normally only $15.  Disc brakes should require no more than a socket set and maybe some allen wrenches.  It's normally only two bolts on the caliper.  Drum brakes will require some specialized tools, but they're very inexpensive.  If you've never done it before, drum brakes work with multiple springs on the inside that have to be replaced in specific order.  You will need to give yourself some time to figure it out, and even better, a camera to take a picture of the other side (it gets old running back and forth to make sure you're doing it right since you'll be doing one wheel at a time; obviously one will still be assembled).  The books will help a lot though.Disc brakes can take as little as 15 minutes to replace, drums as much as a whole day. <SEP> how to install rear brakes on 1993 mazda 929? <EOS>

As a mechanic, I'm going to give you some very good advice, so read carefully. If you have to ask the question in the first place, TAKE IT TO A MECHANIC! Brakes are the ONE THING a novice has NO business messing with, more than any other component of the automobile. If you want to learn about your car, I commend and support you.

You could also try to purchase the product that clean scratches from reading glasses ( I just can't recall the name of it).  Alot of companies, like vision-wear probably sell it.

Look on your tires. You'll see numbers like 185/16R14 or 195/65R15.(Don't you wish people would read the whole question...)The size of the hub caps you need is based on the number after the R.

assuming the cooling system is being refilled after service-fill part way and start engine with the heater on and blower fan on low speed-continue to fill with 50/50 mixture of coolant and distilled water until the thermostat opens-generally around 180-195 degrees-besure to leave the cooling system cap off until all the air has purged from the system through the cap opening-its normally through purging soon after the thermostat opens and the cooling fans engage-dont be alarmed if some coolant bubbles out during the process-also....make sure the engine does'nt overheat during the purging process-which can happen if air gets trapped at the thermostat-just switch off the vehicle and allow to cool,then try again.............good luck! <SEP> how do you bleed the coolant lines on a 1996 chevy cavalier 2.2L engine? <EOS>

If you mean 'popcorn' texture you will need to know what type of texture was used on the ceiling. Although I don't believe anybody uses Asbestos in residential buildings anymore it is still legal to do so and was used through the 1980's in a lot of construction. The laws against Asbestos only forbid it from being developed into new types of products. There are currently dozens of things that Asbestos can be used in legally. If you cannot be sure that your texture is not made from Asbestos you should have a professional contractor remove your texture for you.That said, if you have a steamer spraying the ceiling a little to soften the texture then scraping gently with a spatula (6" is a good size) to remove the popcorn. You could also use a damp sponge with warm water before scraping. Just be careful not to gouge the ceiling with the corner of the spatula. <SEP> How do I remove textured paint from my ceiling? <EOS>

Typically the water will penetrate the varnish and erode the finish.  The resulting exposed wood will appear lighter.  If you dont want to replace the trim or remove it for refinishing you might want to try lightly sanding the areas where the wood is exposed and staining these area with a stain that you can most closely match to the trim.  Then coat the trim in this area with a marine type varnish following the instructions on the label.  You will find that brushing the varnish over the area will blend in the newly stained areas and while it wont look perfect it will look much better than it did.

Disassemble the door’s handle and lock by first removing the screws on the side of the handle and sliding out the mechanism.2. Reattach the damaged veneer and cracked areas of door by mixing up epoxy and filling the cracks using a tongue depressor.3. Place a piece of wax paper over the area and secure the damaged door with a woodworking clamp while the epoxy hardens.4. Since the original opening for the lock mechanism was incorrectly cut, you'll need to use a section of dowel to fill the opening so you can start over.5. Pick a dowel of the appropriate diameter and cut about a 4-inch section. Score grooves along the length of the dowel piece to give the epoxy something to bond to. A good way to do this is by clamping a handsaw upright on a workbench and carefully dragging the dowel across the teeth of the saw.  6. Mix wood epoxy and spread along half of the dowel. Insert dowel into lock hole. Apply the woodworking clamp again while epoxy hardens, about 30 minutes.7. Cut away any excess dowel with a pull saw. Cut as close as possible to door without damaging it. Fill all remaining depressions with adhesive filler.8. Smooth down the area with a rasp followed by sandpaper.9. Drill new hole through dowel for lock using a paddle bit. Orient the doorknob and mark the edge of the mortise while holding the lock plate in position on the door edge.10. Score out the cut for the mortise using a utility knife. Make sure to stay inside the lines you drew.11. Chisel out a mortise, about 1/8-inch deep, using a chisel and hammer.12.

I understand your frustration.  I love pigeons and have bred them for many years, but wild ones can be a pain. The plastic owls, etc., have a deterrent effect of about two days, then the birds get used to them and perch on them pretty much.  If there is no way that you can physically keep the birds out, then I would suggest another possible idea.  Go to a kite store.  Specialty kite shops often have what I call "flapping wing bird" kites. Some of these are designed to look like hawks, gulls, etc.  Get a couple of the hawk ones and post them onto stakes, etc., or from a ceiling, etc., so that they can "fly"They need to be able to "fly" intermittently, either in a natural breeze or perhaps in a fan.  I've suggested this method to a few people in the past and it's seemed to have worked.   The sudden flapping of a "predator" spooks the pigeons and if it happens often enough (without any sort of schedule that they can get used to), they usually decide the "fear" isn't worth it and go somewhere else.Now having said that, I hope you've also closed off places where they may be nesting, etc., so they don't have any urge to come back again.Good luck -- and at some point when you see others suggesting this and charging for it down the road, remember I said it first :-) <SEP> how to drive away the pigeons from my factory shed? they create lot of problem thro their droppings. tried many ways to drive them out. could not sucseed. has any one experienced this. how you are sucessful? <EOS>

Steps:  1.   Determine that a dead battery is the reason your car is not starting. If the engine cranks when you turn the key, the problem is not the battery and jump-starting won't help. If the windshield wipers, lights and heater blower all work, the battery is probably fine and you may have a bad starter. A jump-start won't help if you have a bad starter. If you hear no sound at all when you turn the key or if the engine cranks very slowly and the accessories do not work, then you have a dead or low battery and it's time to break out the jumper cables. You'll need a flashlight if it's dark outside.    2.   Find someone with a running car that can give yours a jump.    3.   Open the hoods on both cars and determine where the batteries are. Park the booster car (the one that's running) so that the batteries are adjacent.   4.   Turn off the booster car.    5.   Attach the red jumper cable's end to the positive terminal on the dead battery. Use a rag to wipe the battery clean if you can't see the Pos or plus (+) sign on the battery. The positive terminal is always slightly larger than the negative one.    6.   Attach the other end of the red cable to the booster battery's positive terminal.    7.   Attach the black jumper cable's end to the booster battery's negative terminal.    8.   Attach the other end of the black jumper cable to a ground on the dead car's engine; any solid metal part works fine. You may see a small spark when you attach the last end. This is normal.   9.   Turn on the booster car and rev the engine.    10.   Turn on the dead car. If it doesn't start, you may have a poor connection at any of the four cable ends. Jiggle each cable end and try starting the car again.  It may take a bit of letting the car sit while the dead battery builds a small charge.    11.   Once the car starts, disconnect the cables in reverse order of attachment: negative, negative, positive, positive.    12.   Keep the engine running on the jumped car for at least 20 minutes or longer so the alternator has sufficient time to recharge your battery.         Overall Tips:   Always store a set of jumper cables in the trunk of your car.     Holding up jumper cables indicates clearly to passing motorists that you need a jump--but stay safely out of the road when you do so.     When buying jumper cables, choose a set that is at least 8 feet (2.5 m) long; this makes it easier to connect the two cars.       Overall Warnings:   Do not reverse the polarity. Make sure the cables are attached as described, to avoid damaging your car's electrical equipment or causing the battery to explode. <SEP> how do you hook up battery cables? <EOS>

Make sure your contractor has a few jobs under his belt.  Its not that I want to dissuede a talented company from getting a start, but you need to know that they can complete a job.  Obviously the longer they have been around the better.2. Naturally check their reputation out with the Better Business Bureau (if you live in the U.S.)3. Here is the strongest point:Know the value of the labor and materials you want to put into the project.  Here's how: - In today's world you can take your sketches to any Home Depot, Lowes and most high end consumer home improvement stores and get them to estimate the materials needed to go into your job.Lets say you are working on a new single car garage.  Altogether Home Depot estimates your cost for a 24 x 24 single car garage to be around $6500.00.  That doesnt include getting the slab dug and poured or the labor to build it.If you have three contractors come in with prices ranging from $12,000 - $25,000 and you know the materials would only cost $6500, FIRST - you need to know what each one is giving you...and then start looking at why the high price is so high.  If its high because they are giving you more, then have them re-bid it WITHOUT the extras.  If its high for no other reason then they are trying to make too much money off of YOU... - Basically, if you know the materials and someone can help you figure out what the labor would cost, then YOU tell the contractor what YOU can afford and DO NOT SWAY FROM IT.So here's how I do it know.  I know I've got a project to build that costs $5,000 in materials.  I figure out that the labor is usually 2/3 of the estimate, so I do my own estimate (more of a guestimate sure) which comes out at $15,000.  THEN I insure that I can afford that cost.THEN I get the estimates.  Whoever has the best experience, best reputation and comes closest to my budgeted number is the contractor I would choose.4. DO NOT close on your deal on the same day the salesman calls on you.  There are some HARDCORE closers out there who MIGHT actually represent good companies, but are only out to line their own pockets with your money with a quick sale.  The background language they use for a person who buys on the same day is a "mooch" - which means you are an easy mark to jack up the price and get a financed sale the same night.  Mooches DO NOT know what things cost.  They don't know materials, they don't know labor and they will sign without reading the contract all the way through.Take a day to read all the proposals - MAKE SURE there is language in the contract that protects YOU the consumer.If you do sign, DON'T FORGET - you have a THREE DAY RIGHT OF RECISION - in most or all states of the US.  Meaning that the contract isn't even VALID until 72 hours AFTER you signed it.Some of the old school tin men I worked for used to "spike" the job.  That means that EVEN THOUGH the recision time wasn't up, they would pull a building permit and put it in the customers window to distract the customer from considering a contract cancellation.Watch for strange behaviors like that.One more thing I remember from my experience.If a salesman calls back to the main office having a "discussion" with the home office, it MIGHT be real...OR...he is having a fake conversation (even if its a pretend one with his boss) where they talk about "saving you money" with some materials they have "left over".  This is UTTER BULLSH*T.  The price has already been jacked up and they are allowing you to feel a sense of false victory in "talki <SEP> how do i not get cheated by a home contractor? <EOS>

Your truck has IFS, independent front suspension. The most you can get from the suspension is about 1.5inch lift, by adjusting the torsion bars to max. This is not recommended because of the added torsional stress on the bars, and your ride will be rough. You can gain a couple inches doing a body lift, again not recommended due to complications with the steering angles, brake lines, cooler lines, etc... and your bumper wont line up with the body, which looks goofy.On a brighter note... you can lift the rear of the truck easily. Adding extra leafs can gain a few inches and increase the load capacity. You can use lift blocks, Max 3inch or you will get axle hop, also this must be done with correctly designed parts to be safe. Finally, you can put large springs in, which is your best bet.If you do it... Do it right. Buy a lift kit from Rancho, Skyjacker, etc. Which ever you choose, unless you are mechanically inclined, get it done professionally. <SEP> how to build a lift kit for a 2000 chevy 4x4? <EOS>
Well there is no special thing to do on your car versus any other car.  Just take off a plug wire buy twisting the wire as you pull so you won't damage the wire.  Put a socket on the plug and unscrew it.  Make sure you gap it to 52-56 on the plug.  Put some grey anti-seize on the treads and screw them in to 15Nm or about as tight as a oil drain plug.  Also put some dielectical grease on the boots so the boots won't be so hard to remove next time and moisture stays out.  Then go on to the next one.  Just do them one at a time so you don't cross any wires and make sure they don't touch the exhaust.  Keep the wires from touching each other if you can so any spark doesn't just to another wire.  That's all there is to it.Also Jeep Freak has a good point on screwing them in.  The first guy is thinking of a newer mustang.

Air conditioning systems are closed systems, so they should never need recharging.  If it does, it means there's a leak.  You'll pretty much have to take it to a repair shop/dealership.  They add freon, with a 2003 it'll probably take synthetic, which is a little more expensive.  If you have a warranty still, this should be covered.  A good place will add dye, so that they can trace the leak.  If it's just a small leak, the recharge may last a couple of years.  If it's bigger, in a few weeks they'll want to look at it again, and search for the leak using a blacklight to detect the dye. <SEP> How do I recharge the air on my 2003 Honda Element? <EOS>

What I ended up doing, which worked really well, was creating an email with some text in the body:   This is a test of the email system.   This is not a real spam message, but   rather one that is trying to purposely   get into the spam folder of another   account. This is so that I can ensure   that my Gmail filters are setup   correctly.   ... and a subject line such as:   Test Spam Message 1   I always incremented the number at the end of the subject for each message I sent. This way it doesn't look like a duplicate to Gmail and is actually delivered.  Next, on the receiving account, I decided to go ahead and mark the message as spam. I read in the help that it mentions that marking a message as spam is reversible. They even give an example of how a user might accidentally mark a message as spam, then undo it. This is exactly what I am hoping to emulate.  After marking the first message as spam, all the others (which contain the exact same body and only differ in the subject by one letter) are sent to spam as well.  Once I was done with the testing, I marked all the messages as non-spam. Hopefully Gmail treats this as a user accidentally marking a message as spam and doesn't resort to blacklisting the address or doing something worse.  Update: After trying this again, I had to mark a message as spam twice before anything started happening, and then I noticed weird behaviors on the account that was sending the "spam". The account was automatically logged off, and I couldn't log back in for a while. This might be an automated measure Gmail takes when users report other Gmail users as spammers. <SEP> How can I purposely send a message that will be marked as spam in Gmail? <EOS>

Mix some powdered sugar with Twenty Mule Team Borax, about fifty fifty.  The borax kills the roaches.  They ingest it while going agter the sugar.  Using a plastic squeeze bottle like you might find in restaurants, squirt the mixture along all of the baseboards in the house.  If you have a basement, put it on the sills and floor studs, and put all along the edges of the attic, if you have one.  Repeat as needed.  Roaches tend to infest neighboring houses and trees, so you will probably have to retreat the house regularly.  Another thing you can put down is diatomaceous earth, or silica.  This is very effective since they track it back to the nests and it helps kill other roaches too.

Usually the check engine light comes on when there is a malfunction present. Best thing to do is plug in an OBDII Scanner (if you have one) to see whats wrong with the vehicle (if anything).

They should be able to tell you why its on & turn it off for you unless there is an active issue that requires repair & will only turn the light back on.

Great automotive questionBut that's a problem that's extremely difficult to solve, at least on a permanent basis.It's caused by the growth of fungi in the ac evaparator case, manufactuers have been faced with this complaint for years. Especially in geographic regions with high humidity and temperatures.There are numerous products on the market that propose to eliminate the odor, but I've never seen one that permanately resolves the smell. Usually they will work for a short period of time and the smell reappears.Most dealerships and some auto repair shops will have a chemical and special tool that is sprayed inside the evaporator core to slow down this fungi growth, and hopefully stop the smell.You may be able to purchase similar products at your local parts house as well, it should come with instructions on how to use.One Important tip--------Using your ac on outside air on a frequent basis will help slow down this condition to some degree. The outside air keeps moisture from building up in the evaporator case, thus preventing the growth of fungi.It will also help the evap case dry if you turn your ac mode on "outside air" before shutting off the engine for long periods of time.Jerry Christopherhttp://www.usedcarwise.com <SEP> How can I get rid of the musty smell coming out of my cars AC.? <EOS>

Other problems include a blown fuse, faulty wiring, faulty dimmer switch. <SEP> how do you fix a car headlamp? <EOS>
The piece of plastic that is the width of the car, is an air deflector and has to be removed to get at the 2 retainers that hold the headlamp in place. I use a pair of side wire cutters to remove the nail shaped plugs. If you do wreck the plugs, you can get them at any automotive parts store or your G.M. dealer which are pretty inexpensive. Should only be couple of dollars for all the plugs. Next you will notice two black retainers at the back of each headlamp assembly after the black air deflector is removed. Lift up or pull up on these 2 retainers to disengage the headlamp assembly and then pull the headlamp straight forward from the headlamp mounting panel. Remember to not touch the glass of the NEW bulb with your finger tips because the oil on your fingertips will cause the bulb to burn out prematurely. I hope this will help you. <SEP> How do I replace the headlights on a 2005 Grand Am? The manual states that the headlight assembly must be tilted up and forward out of the front of the car before there will be any access to the rear side of the assembly to twist and remove the bulbs. The issue is removing the assembly in the first place -- the manual indicates that there is a snap in piece of plastic locking the entire assembly in place, but the actual car does not match the images in the manual, and there is a large piece of plastic which spans the entire width of the car. This piece of plastic appears to be secured with plastic nail-shaped plugs that don't seem to want to come out without being broken (probably single-usage snaps meant to be replaced). Do you know how to remove the assembly in the first place to access the rear side of it? <EOS>

At the end of the pool season, you’ll need to make preparations to safely close your pool for the winter months. Talk to your dealer for the steps you need to take for your climate. The first step toward closing your pool should be to take a water sample to your Authorized Sustain® System Dealer. He’ll give you an end-of-the-season analysis and offer winterizing recommendations. Use Sustain Winterizing Products, designed to protect your pool against algae during the off-season, and make opening your pool next season a breeze. Simply follow these steps:Follow your dealer's instructions to adjust Total Alkalinity and other water balance factors during pool closing. You should have 1-3 ppm Free Available Chlorine (FAC) before proceeding to Step #2. Keep the pump running continuously for thorough mixing of chemicals until Step 3 is completed. Pour in Sustain Winter Shield® Chlorine Extender, using 32 fluid ounces for every 20,000 gallons of water. (Add only six fluid ounces if the pool has less than 7,500 gallons.) "Superchlorinate" your pool, using a double dose of Sustain® Shock Treatment (2 pounds for every 10,000 Gallons). Be sure to follow label directions to avoid bleaching of vinyl liners. Clean your pool, filter and all other mechanical equipment thoroughly. Partially drain your pool. Check with your Sustain® System Dealer to determine proper water levels and procedures for your climate. Cover your pool with a solid pool cover. Over the course of the pool season, many factors will change the balance of your pool water. When water is added to the pool, whether by rain or your garden hose, the pool water is diluted and the strength of the chemicals is lowered. Remember, the key to effective pool care is to maintain a balance: a change in one area will affect the overall balance of the chemicals. The main water balance factor that will need to be adjusted is pH. Frequent water testing is important to monitor pH and other water balance factors.Three-Way Test StripsAlternatively, use Three-Way Test Strips to routinely monitor pH, TA and FAC. Although extremely convenient, these strips are not as precise as a DPD Two-Way Test Kit. The Three-Way Strips indicate a range, instead of an exact reading. The pH level will read low if TA is 80 ppm or below. Also, the indicator for FAC is different than DPD (its purple, rather than pink), so the readings may differ slightly. When testing with the Three-Way Test Strips, handle the strips with clean, dry hands, keeping the bottle tightly capped between uses. Store in a cool place.Sustain® 3-Inch Blue Chlorinating Tablets are the general sanitizing components of the 3-part system. They are designed to deliver chlorine consistently when used with their skimmer dispenser cups. Each tablet contains a patented erosion modifier that controls erosion across the top (exposed surface) of the tablet. Fill the skimmer dispenser cup with 3-Inch Sustain® blue chlorinating tablets each week. Adjust the lid opening to increase or decrease chlorine delivery to maintain 1-3 ppm FAC. For in-ground pools, start with the lid off, and use it later, if necessary. For above-ground pools, start with the lid fully open and adjust as needed. Remember that chlorine demand increases with more direct sunlight, heat and greater pool use. Shield Energizer Tablets should be used once a week to act as both a shock treatment and means for keeping Sustain® Summer Shield Chlorine Extender charged with added chlorine protection. Unlike the 3-Inch tablets, Energizer does not contain an erosion modifier. The tablets are designed to dissolve quickly (usually within two hours). Add Shield Energizer Tablets each week. Remember to adjust pH to 7.2 (especially if it is 7.5 or higher) before adding Energizer Tablets. Add one cup per 5,000 gallons of water to the skimmer basket. After adding the Energizer Tablets, circulate continuously for at least 5 hours. Your wee <SEP> how do I learn to maintain my pool? testing water and adding the right chemicals <EOS>

The filter case is salvageable even if the top nut is stripped. There are a half dozen ways to do this and it all depends on the space you have to work with, how far down that nut is engaged and your skill with hand tools. I've had to do this twice with stubborn hayward cart filters and had to use a different approach both times. Your best bet is to get a tech in. There's just too many "ifs" here to suggest one method over another and ideally you want to start with what may work with the least damage, first. No telling what that is unless you post a picture of it or have someone actually look at it. If you have room and the nut isn't engaged fully, myself, I'd be cutting off the plastic surrounding the brass for both a better look and to see if it's worth a shot at cutting the brass threading off being careful not to ding up the rod threads. Like I said though, it's all a judgment call. If you do decide to tackle it, be careful.You can easily bugger up the lid and also potentially snap the rod out of the base. The lid isn't cheap and the base is fatal. <SEP> How do you remove a "stripped" top from a Hayward C900 pool filter? Without damaging the filter body? <EOS>

Open the drivers side door and look along the edge of the door (the part that concealed when the door is closed which is where the door latching mechanism is). There should be a sticker there which gives the paint code among other things. Keep in mind that the car is  7 years old so a perfect match is not possible. To better match the paint use a very fine grit compound after you let the repainted areas dry for several days, this will help blend the two colors together. <SEP> How do I find the paint color code on my car?

All of those answers are good ones depending on how bad (big) the leak is.If is really small (pin-hole) then the pepper idea is best.  A little bigger but still not a crack then the egg will get you to the next town (it won't help you keep the vehicle alive while you sell it though).The stop-leak additives haven't proven to me to be worth much though.  You'll spend money on them for a poor and temporary fix at best when you really need to repair the problem.Ok, this again depends on size and location of the leak.If it's leaking at a solder joint, you might be able to remove the radiator and re-solder it without spending too much money...you'll need a good work area and a torch, acid core-flux, wire-brush and some solder.  Oh, by the way, you'll need some talent too.  Working with a molten metal can be a little dangerous for the uninitiated.I'd recommend a radiator rebuild shop or a junk-yard (PC--Vehicle Salvage yard).  New radiators are really spendy and you said the vehicle wasn't worth it.Cheapest way out?Since "it is not worth spending money replacing the radiator" I have the perfect solution:Drain the radiator dry (now it won't leak any more).  Don't ever drive it again.  Have it towed (or push it) to it's final resting place.  If it's not worth a radiator, it's not worth anything. <SEP> how can I stop my car radiator from leaking?

Just like you would break in any camshaft.

The obvious answer for me is to shift the car into neutral and then use the brakes.  Brake pad replacement is one heck of a lot cheaper than a clutch replacement and that's not the only thing that wears on on the transmission!Everytime you shift gears you exercise the syncromesh  associated with each forward gear.  Reverse generally doesn't need any such syncromesh which is why sometimes it is difficult to get into reverse.The clutch throw-out bearing is given a large break too when you leave that clutch pedal out as much as possible.  In that possition the throw-out bearing is not being used.  Held down to the floor, the throw-out bearing is working it's tail off!When the transmission is in neutral the engine speed decreases to idle speed, around 800 rpm.  At that point I am using very little fuel while the ground under the tires is still passing under the car pretty quickly.  That translates to fuel economy!  A quick kick up in rpm and I can put it in any gear I want.The only reason I can give for downshifting through your deceleration is to gain the capacity for a quick acceleration.  That is easily solved with some defensive driving techniques and it really isn't that slow shifting into whatever gear I want when I need it anyway!My '90 Honda Prelude has 230,000 miles on it's original clutch!  The only thing that has been replaced is the clutch acutation parts since that is controlled by hydraulics with a master and a slave cylinder similar to the brake system. <SEP> How do you stop when you drive manual transmission car?

First you contact your local police department -- The easiest way is to remove the ignition switch on top of the steering collum near the firewall - the key turns a rod that operates this switch and allows you to access the run / start / off  without a key -- however newer cars have more than a few security devices in place to ensure that this will not allow you to drive away with the car -- those i won't mention.The 'theory' is to provide all power requirements to the ignition circuits (including computer lines) and then engage the starter - in practice the security devices from the factory to avoid a simple jumper wire or two are numerous - and that is without aftermarket security systems. <SEP> How do u hotwire a car?

First, make sure you either drain the tank or run it down as far as possible. If your truck has a carb engine, the first thing you will need to do is to disconnect the fuel lines from the sending unit in the tank. If your truck has fuel injection, you will need to relieve the pressure in the fuel system before removing the lines. If you should happen to forget to do this, don't panic. You will just have some spray when you disconnect the lines. Once you have removed the lines from the sending unit, next remove any wiring for the sending unit. You may find it easier to remove the wires, and the fuel lines for that matter, if you  lower the tank a little.  If your tank has a rubber hose type filler neck, make sure to remove it from the tank. You can lower the tank slightly be loosening the gas tank straps that hold the tank in the truck. When you are sure that you have disconnected everything, you can remove the straps from one side at a time. You may need an extra pair of hands, too! Slowly lower the tank down and out. Installation is just the reverse. <SEP> how do you replace the fuel tank on a 1987 gmc pickup truck? <EOS>

I'm going to assume you are talking about the copper lines that run between the indoor and outdoor units.  The only line that needs to be wrapped is the suction line, the bigger of the two, which will also be the cold one of the two.  Try Home Depot, or a store like that, ask for pipe insulation; you will need to know the outside diameter of the pipe for the type you can slide over the pipe.  If you can't do it that way, ask for a roll of cork or tar-like insulation wrap.  You simply unroll the wrap at an angle around the pipe, keeping it somewhat taught, andoverlapping it a little for whatever length you need.  It is plyable enough that you can kind of mold it to the pipe.  This will prevent the cold pipe from sweating and getting a layer or buildup of frost. <SEP> how do you wrap the freon line of an air conditioner? <EOS>

IMPORTRANGE() appears to be the function you want.  From the Google spreadsheets function list :   Google Spreadsheets lets you reference   another workbook in the spreadsheet   that you're currently editing by using   the ImportRange function. ImportRange   lets you pull one or more cell values   from one spreadsheet into another. To   create your own ImportRange formulas,   enter =importRange(spreadsheet-key,   range). For languages where comma is   used for decimal separation, use a   semicolon instead of a comma to   separate arguments in your formula.  Spreadsheet-key is a STRING which is   the key value from the spreadsheet   URL.  Range is a STRING representing the   range of cells you want to import,   optionally including the sheet name   (defaults to first sheet). You can   also use a range name if you prefer.  Given that the two arguments are   STRINGs, you need to enclose them in   quotes or refer to cells which have   string values in them.  For example:  =importrange("abcd123abcd123", "sheet1!A1:C10") "abcd123abcd123" is   the value in the "key=" attribute on   the URL of the target spreadsheet and   "sheet1!A1:C10" is the range which is   desired to be imported.  =importrange(A1,B1) Cell A1 contains the string ABCD123ABCD123 and cell B1   contains sheet1!A1:C10  Note: In order to use ImportRange, you   need to have been added as a viewer or   collaborator to the spreadsheet from   which ImportRange is pulling the data.   Otherwise, you'll get this error:   "#REF! error: The requested   spreadsheet key, sheet title, or cell   range was not found."   "key" is of course the string in the URL for the spreadsheet that matches to the key= parameter.  I just tested it by creating two spreadsheets. In cell A1 of the first I put a string. In cell A1 of the second I put =importRange("tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A","A1") and it displayed the string from the first spreadsheet. (Your key will obviously be different.)  (The format of the function may depend on your locale. In France the formula is not valid with a comma, so you'll need to be replace it with a semi-colon: =importRange("tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A";"A1") )  NOTES:   Google currently sets a hard limit of 50 "cross-workbook reference formulas" per spreadsheet. Source: Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides size limits . (h/t JJ Rohrer )  The "new" Google Spreadsheet (soon to be the standard) removes the 50 limit of 50 "cross-workbook reference formulas ( Google Support ) (h/t Jacob Jan Tuinstra )   In the "new" Google Sheets you also use the entire URL as the key ( Google Support ) (h/t Punchlinern ) <SEP> How do I link a cell in Google Spreadsheets to a cell in another document? <EOS>

A nasty stain or unsightly hole doesn't have to ruin the whole carpet. Patch it.       Steps:  1.   Cut out the entire damaged area with a utility knife. Try to do this with just one cut on each side and avoid cutting through the carpet pad.    2.   Use the cut-out piece as a pattern to cut a new piece. Be sure to match the direction of the pile.    3.   Spread carpet adhesive on the exposed carpet pad and on the back of the patch itself.    4.   Put some adhesive under the edges of the carpet surrounding the hole as well.    5.   Press the patch into the hole and rough up the pile with your fingertips.    6.   Let the glue dry for about six hours and then vacuum the patched area.        Tips:   If you accidentally cut the carpet pad, fasten it down with a piece of wide duct tape.     If you don't happen to have extra matching carpet, get a remnant at a carpet store. Take your damaged piece with you when you go to the store to help you find a good match.

Power washing is a Definite necessity!!! Keep the pressure under 1500psi to avoid damaging the wood. IF you are going to repaint it, you will NOT need to strip off the old finish completely. Just power wash to remove most of the peeling paint and all of the dirt. Finish with a light hand-scraper. Spot prime any bare wood areas with a suitable primer for your type of wood and repaint with an Acrylic Latex paint suitable for floors and decks.

If you go to any autoparts store like AutoZone, they will do it for you.  Otherwise just purchase a Cross Iron, it has four of the most common tire bolt (called lug nuts) sizes.

First, if you ran out of oil it is possible you MAY have drawn some sludge into the line and clogged the orifice (nozzle) in the burner. It must be cleaned or replaced. Unless you're a good mechanic AND you know what you're doing let a serviceman do it.MORE  LIKELY,  if you did draw sludge from your tank into the supply line it may very well have 'gummed up' the in-line filter (if you have one) - most systems do. You MAY have to replace the filter element and,  if you do replace it,  fill the canister and filter assembly with fuel oil before reassembling it. This is the best way to prime the line and it saves a lot of bleeding time and by not having the canister filled you may not be able to completely bleed the system. Sounds like either a clogged filter (most likely) or a clogged nozzle(orifice) or BOTH!  One other thing - if you know when your oil deliveries are scheduled make an effort to have someone home and have them turn off the emergency shut-off switch (usually a red wallplate) prior to the delivery. Leave it off for 2 hours or so before turning it back on. The reason? When oil is pumped into the tank it stirs up the 'gunk and junk' which has settled to the bottom of the tank and this 'stuff' stays suspended in the oil for some time after the delivery. By not running the oil burner for several hours you give the 'gunk' a chance to settle back to the bottom of the tank and not be pulled into the supply line where it does its dirty deeds.Good luck! <SEP> how do i prime my oil burner/furnace? i recently ran out of oil in my oil burner/furnace, and now that the thing is full again it won't turn back on. i've already tried bleeding the thing and that doesn't work. where i live it is very cold and i need help fast!!! <EOS>
Mice thrive where food is plentiful and harborage is present. Any steps that reduce these two requirements willdiscourage their numbers.Good housekeeping is imperative. The eliminationof hiding places is particularly important, andholes in walls, floors, or foundations must be sealed off or screened over to prevent new infestations.Migrations from adjoining fields often occur with thecoming of cold weather in the fall of the year.Mice can squeeze through holes over ¼ inch indiameter, so it is important that foundations, doors,and windows be frequently inspected and smallopenings closed.Light infestations of mice can be removed throughthe use of several ordinary snap traps.Poisoned baits will reduce heavy infestations of housemice. <SEP> how to prevent mice from coming in the house? <EOS>

First read your manual and find out how much and what kind of oil your car needs.  This is very important on newer cars whose tolerance is so small.Then go to the autoparts store and ask for a filter for your car and get the oil you need.  You should also have an oil filter wrench.  I reccomebd the ring kind not the kind tha fits over the top ore the visegrip kind.You might also want to get something conviniant to catch the oil in and tote it around.  You will need to take it back to a place that collects old oil.Then get on your back and find the drain plug.  Wait till you car is cool though.  Undo the plug and let the oil drain into the pan you got.  Next you need to find your oil filter.  You have a new one so you should be able to look for something the same shape.  it may be a different color though.Turn the old filter counter clock wise.  be ready though oil will come out a small amount anyway.Turn it over on your drain pan and let the rest run out of the filter.Put a small amount of oil on your finger and rub the gasket on the new filter.  Put it where the old one was and hand tighten only.  If it is easy to do without spilling oil you you should also prime the filter by pouring some oil into it.Replace the filter and the drain plug.  Fill you car oil fill (under the hood) to the recommended amount.  Replace the cap.  I have forgotten to do that a couple of times.

My personal favorite lately has been When2meet .  Time selection is easily clickable/draggable, reporting is intuitive and visual, and there's minimal setup involved (read: practically none).  There is no contact list integration, but you can send the short, private link directly to your recipients.  And, of course, it's free!  The only criterion listed above which I'd say it falls a bit short on is the ability for the organizer to specify time intervals that are "on the table".  You can specify a list of dates, and a range of times on those dates, but that range must be contiguous and the same across dates.  In effect, the organizer doesn't get special priority in limiting the choices.

Wow, I just did this last weekend!  If it's floor tile, the easiest way to do it is to use a dremel with a tile bit.  It only took me about an hour to do my whole kitchen floor.  I just had the dremel in one hand and the shop vac in the other and ran the bit down the grout lines and it drilled it all out.  I just set my depth for the bit about 1/4" let the tile be my guide as I had the bit touching the edge of one tile during the first pass and the edge of the other tile on the way back through that line.  I was worried about it chipping the tile, but it didn't...maybe I got lucky...use at your own risk.  The second way which I started out doing and it took forever was to use a grout saw it's like a screwdriver with a saw blade on the end of it shaped like a blade you put in a utility knife but with teeth and just saw out the grout.  Just start sawing along a tile edge, then saw the edge on the other tile, then break out the grout between the saw lines and suck it all up with the shop vac.  I spent $10 on the grout saw and $8 on the dremel bit (actually made by rotozip but it fits in a dremel) at Home Depot.  If you have a dremel, I'd definately suggest using it for a floor, for a wall I'd CAREFULLY try the dremel bit but probably recommend the saw. <SEP> how do i remove grout from between tiles? <EOS>

When the pump system is water logged, you have lost the capacity in the tank itself. One way to check it is look for a "water line" on the tank if it is a metal tank. If the ater is cold enough, you will see condensation form at the level of the water. If it is a fiberglass tank, let the pump pump up to pressure and shut off. Make sure nothing is using water in the house or building. Get a 5 gallon bucket and put it under a faucet and open the faucet. Count the gallons it takes before the pump comes back on. If the pump comes on immediately, the system is definitely water logged. Most tanks have a 5 to 20 gallon drawn down gallons, or the gallons that it puts out before the pump comes back on. To "un-water log" the tank, drain the tank down all the way and fill it back up. The pump should add air to the tank as it pumps. The is also some kind of air volumn control either on the tank or in the well piping. Make sure it is working properly and letting air out or adding air, depending on the style of control. Hope this helps! Good luck! <SEP> How do you tell if your water tank is water logged and what are the symptoms of the water well pump if this oc <EOS>
R-134a uses a different fitting and a different set of guages to properly charge your system. The 134 guages are calibrated different from the old R-12 guages. This does not mean you can't use your R-12 guages (assuming you have any) you just have to know what the pressure differential is. Adapters can be purchased to fit the fittings on your car. The color of the cap is irrelevant, that is just a GM thing. You did not mention whether the fitting was on the liquid line (small line) or suction side (large line), I will assume it is the suction side for now. GM and other manufacturers have moved the other fitting closer to the AC compressor, look where the lines come off the compressor, especially underneath on the bottom, you will likely find the fitting there.

4 years... any fuel will probably have turned into varnish by now, most likely battery is bad. To start remove all mouse, bird and varmit nests. Change the oil and filter, turn crank by hand to make sure the engine isn't siezed from rust. Pull fuel line from tank and flush tank with fresh petrol. Reconnect fuel line to tank and put in several litres. Install new battery and petrol pump. Clean and gap plugs, install new plug wires. Check all electrical for chewed or frayed wires(even covered and garaged the mice get in). There may also be flat spots on the cam after sitting for so long. The rings could be rusted and break at start up. Both of the last two statements are just educated guesses. If you feel comfortable gently try starting the car by bumping the starter.

I agree with the above for how you figure the yardage.  If you're ordering for a slab then you'll take the square footage of the slab then take that times the depth in feet (if it's 4" thick then 0.33').  If it's a wall same principle, take the length of the wall times the height times the thickness.If you're using an 80 pound bag of concrete mix (includes cement, sand, and coarse aggregates) then the yield is going to depend on how much water you add, but i'd say you're probably going to get about 2/3rds to 3/4's of a cubic foot out of each bag depending on the amount of water you add. <SEP> how do you calculate cement yardage? <EOS>

Very carefully. If your car has a distributor ignition system. You must keep it water tight or your car may not run any more. Also make sure to cover up the carb or throttle body if you have one. Watch how you spray around the alternator, it could also get damaged. I would recommend using a low pressure water hose. After all of that I would start with something like a spray one Mean Green degreaser or a good foaming degreaser. Then rise and use a good metal polish on valve covers and anything else metal, then use an armor all protectant for hoses and any plastic trim you may have. By this time your engine sound look like new. You can also add some detailing features like spray painting any thing that may look old and dull. Painting your block is also a nice touch.

We went through the moisture problem and crawlspace vent issue years ago.  We found that there were conflicting opinions about vents, moisture barriers, sump pumps and proper ventilation. We were enlightened when we researched more.We found each home can have its own solutions but the moisture levels in the wood tell you much.  When moisture levels are over 20%, decay is inevitable but not rotting yet.  Moisture levels over 28% means the wood decay fungi is active (it feeds on the starch of your wood to rot it) and there is likely visible damage already.  Fungi and mold do not grow or become active if the levels are lower.  Generally, air flow keeps moisture levels down.Here is a Clemson University PDF home maintenance publication about moisture levels and control at :http://virtual.clemson.edu/groups/psapublishing/PAGES/FYD/HL255.pdf  Also NC State has one at http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/fcs/housing/pubs/fcs486.htmlThis is good too.

In every vehicle there are 2 parts to the cooling system. Whats in the radiator and whats in the engine block. The thermostat sits between them. when you start you car your engine warms up and the coolant in the engine block gets hot. when it reaches the right temperature the thermostat starts to open allowing some of the cold water from the radiator to circulate round the engine. That's how the system works. So for a really simple test, start your car from cold and wait 10 minutes.

Hey, this is just my type of question.  I am called the Princess of Plumbing in my town and my suggestion to callers when they call in with this situation is to get a pail of water and pour it down each floor drain.

Try this before you hire a plumber. <SEP> HOw do I get rid of a Sewer smell that comes after the upstairs toilet is flushed.?

Year, make and model would help here. If you have a rack and pinion unit, yes remove the return line at the pump (usually the hose with a clamp on it) than turn the wheel back and fourth lock to lock a few times and this will purge most of the fluid out. If you have a gear box type than it will not work this way..   Both systems could be flushed in this manor, Remove return line and cap the nipple on the reservoir, put return line over or in a container to catch waste fluid, pour proper type of fluid into reservoir as vehicle is running while another person turns wheel slowly back and fourth this will effectively flush clean the system ( 1 or 2 quarts should do). <SEP> How do you completely drain the power steering fluid?

How to Unclog a ToiletUnclogging a toilet is not exactly the most entertaining way to spend a day, but it's something we all have to face at one point or another in our lives. When you're renting a place, the worst case scenerio is that you have to have maintenance come and fix your clog. But when you're a homeowner, you definitely want to avoid having a plumber come over.So, after several days of battling toilets in my house and searching the web for unique techniques, here are my three Ping-certified recommended steps to unclogging your toilet: Plunge... First, you obviously want to use your plunger to try and loosen any clogs. Start by making a seal over the hole-in-the-bowl with the plunger. Push down slowly and pull back quickly. Start by doing this at a slow pace and then working up speed. Use a toilet snake/auger... I dislike this step because it can scrape the porcelein, but it's necessary if the plunger doesn't do the job. Make sure you get a toilet snake/auger, as a sink snake/auger will scrape the porcelein on your toilet. Trust me. Work the snake as far back into the hole as possible, trying to dislodge any tissue or solid matter (mmmm... tasty). Pour a bucket of water... If the snake still doesn't let you flush the toilet successfully, this is what finally did it for me. This step can also be used before the plunger in the case of a very small clog, but works well as a last step with a stubborn clog. Get a normal sized bucket and fill it between 1/8 and 1/4 of the way full with warm water. When the water in the toilet is at its lowest point (usually with clogged toilets, very little water is left in the bottom), pour the water directly into the hole-in-the-bowl from about waist-high. The pressure of the water being poured into the bowl does a surprisingly good job at disloding the remaining clog. You may need to repeat this step once or twice. <SEP> How can I get a toilet unclogged? We have tried using a plunger and nothing it working.  It flushed but now it is just overflowing.  Thanks! <EOS>
Head to Auto Zone or a similar auto parts place. They make a filler that stops the spidering of your windshield, and fills the glass so you can hardly tell it's there. The absolute best thing to do is to replace it, but if you can't afford it at the moment (it's not as expensive as you think) then that will do the trick. It isn't a guaranteed thing, though - sometimes it will be weak in just the right place, and it's inevitable to get a big crack. I wish you luck! <SEP> How can I fix a cracked windshield?

The wood that keeps water and termites from causing damage are placed in vats of chemicals and pressurized in cylinders that allow the preservative to penetrate the entire piece of wood. You can't reproduce this by applying anything to the surface. The best surface sealers are modified water born epoxy resins. They last about 5 years with proper application because they penetrate and bond to wood fibers better than oil based ones such as Thompson's. They resist mildew because they don't contain any organic oils, and are less effected by UV light. Most of your sealers won't last more than 2 years, and aren't much cheaper than the epoxies. <SEP> How can you make wood preservers?? the ones that protect wood from termites weathering etc...? <EOS>

"Crackchecker" is right.  The foot valve is located at the end of the water supply line at the bottom of the well.  The line will need to be pulled out of the well in order to replace it.Replacing the foot valve will be cheaper than installing a submersible pump.  Maintenance on either system requires that the water line and foot valve/submersible pump be pulled out of the well.Good luck with your project. <SEP> how do i replace a foot valve on a well system? <EOS>

1st soak the nut with any penetrate solvent such as WD40, Liquid Wrench or PB Blaster. These are available at any auto parts store. While the nut is soaking with the penetrate tap the nut vibration will allow additional penetrate into the threads to help loosen them.2nd. Try loosening the nut again while tapping the nut.If this does not come loose you might want to try a little heat, with a propane torch. IF YOU DO USE THE HEAT MAKE SURE YOU REMOVED THE PENETRATE AND WASHED ALL THE SURFACES. THE PENETRATES ARE EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE.REMEMBER: Righty an tighty. Lefty a loosey. Unless for some reason you have a left handed nut then the process would be reversed. <SEP> How can I loosen and remove a stubborn nut from my kitchen faucet?
