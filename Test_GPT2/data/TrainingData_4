Porcelain knives are very expensive. For what you would pay for a special sharpener, you'd be better off having it done by a professional. What type of cutting board are you using?

If you are good friends with a technician at a local repair center (or if you are good at becoming good friends with people quickly) they may help you out for next to nothing. Some libraries (especially in collage towns) have a version of electronic service information available to the public. You can also take a trip down to your local auto parts store and purchase a Chilton or Haynes manual for around $20, these manuals are limited in the information they give you but they have descriptions of DTC’s (Diagnostic Trouble Codes). From there you can do your pin-point tests to determine the root cause of the problem that set the code. Additionally, there are vast sources on the internet for such information. A simple search could help you determine what the number means; however to properly diagnose the problem, you are going to need access to a bit more than what is available for free on the internet. All Data has a service available that allows you to access the same information shops have for a small fee. And, if you are looking for guidance in repairing the problem yourself, I myself can assist you VIA e-mail. I am in the process of setting up a small internet business unlike any other I have come across, where I walk people through problems with their vehicles for a small fee—cheaper than going to a shop or misdiagnosing and buying unneeded parts, yet enough to make it worth my while to do every night. If you are interested in my assistance (free for now) email me at the address I have in the source section (it isn't a link, type it in replacing the word "at" with the symbol and no spaces) Please note that I don’t have direct access to service information at this time; however, I can make a phone call to one of my old tech school instructors to obtain information for you, it just might take a couple of days—longer if I need to have flow-charts and such sent. I hope this helps!<SEP>How can i define trouble codes that are retreved from vechicle dianogstic machine? my vechicle is showing a check engine light i found the code but dont know what it mean<EOS>
If you are working with concrete you may want to start at the top of the hill and work downward.  This way gravity helps you pull the concrete into place.  If you had the limestone delivered in a concrete mixer, called pugging, then you could basically do the same thing.  Limestone will not hold on steeper than a 20% grade.  In this case you want to definitely use concrete or asphalt.  Also, have you thought about using landings for the driveway to reduce the steepness at the garage and at the shoulder of the street?  Its a good idea.<SEP>How do you build/install a crushed limestone driveway up a hill? We have already graded the dirt road?<EOS>

I'm not sure what brand of edger you have, but I experienced a similar issue with an old walk behind craftsman edger I had. It was a three wheel with a three tip blade. What I did was to put a piece of wood (2x4 or something similar) underneather the blade. This allows the blade to 'grip' something without damaging the blade itself. (I also use this method for our commercial mower blades)Once the wood is under the blade, I put my knee (or any applicable pressure onto the top cover that went over the blade. This forced the blade to sit still while I applied the pressure to the nut.If you want to provide a model number of the edger, I can look at a picture and see if I have a solution more specific to your edger.<SEP>How do you change out a walk behind edger blade?

Proper tire inflation.Empty out excess junk from your car.Proper maintenance, oil change, air filters, spark plugs.Driving habits -- Drive smoothly, no full throttle stops.  Look ahead and anticipate what traffic and traffic lights are going to do.  No need to continue acceleration of the light ahead is red, coast to the light.Lower your driving speeds.  If I recall, wind resistance increases as a square related to your speed.  So if you double your speed, you will quadruple the wind resistance.Remove your roof rack or other such things from the top of your vehicle.Next time you need new tires, see if you can "downsize" to a more narrow tire.  Of course, keep in mind the tire must fit and carry at least as much load as the previous size.But the biggies are in HOW you drive.Also, not related to fuel economy, but fuel consumption, see about combining trips, or planning the most efficient route.<SEP>how to get bettr gas milage? i have a pt cruiser and it does not get very good gas milage like it should.how can i improve it?<EOS>

Very carefully. If your car has a distributor ignition system. You must keep it water tight or your car may not run any more. Also make sure to cover up the carb or throttle body if you have one. Watch how you spray around the alternator, it could also get damaged. I would recommend using a low pressure water hose. After all of that I would start with something like a spray one Mean Green degreaser or a good foaming degreaser. Then rise and use a good metal polish on valve covers and anything else metal, then use an armor all protectant for hoses and any plastic trim you may have. By this time your engine sound look like new. You can also add some detailing features like spray painting any thing that may look old and dull. Painting your block is also a nice touch. If your exhaust manifold are looking rusty. They make a high temp stainless looking paint that will brighten that up as well.

1)Check underneath the sink where the dishwasher drains to; either tha garbage disposer or a branch tee on the strainer side. Remove the hose. Check for any blockage. If that dont work check it on the DW end. While you got it off, see if you can run water through it. Reinstall the hose. Turn DW on. 2) Move the timer to where it normally drains. You should hear a "clunk" noise. If not remove the kickplate. On the motor itself is a cellanoid with an arm attached to it. This is the drain cellanoid. Turn the DW back on and manually raise or lower the arm while its still on the drain cycle. It should do it itself. If the DW drains while you manually raise or lower the arm then the cellanoid needs replaced. 3) If it moves on its own but the motor doesnt turn, Turn the DW off. Insert a flathead screwdriver into the side slots on the motor. Move the screwdriver back and forth til the motor turns freely<SEP>how to i fix a dishwasher that won't drain?<EOS>
I feel it has to do with who views your page, for how long, who you view, for how long,  and how frequently you search them. Your friends probably has a somewhat large value to show up first and/or their friends and the value can probably be lowered than a non-friend due to the time factor spent on a non-friend's page. Maybe even clicks is played into the search. There is a complicated formula. Facebook is crazy about this stuff. In the movie, when Mark (facebook CEO) did the site about which girl at school was hot or not, he ask a friend to come up with a formula to determine a winner. With how brilliant facebook has become, I don't doubt for a second that they take into consideration all these factors and 20,000 others when designing this formula.  I liked this guy and I couldn't find his page. Of course he was searching me as well and I'm assuming the reason why I was unable to search him was because he made his page only searchable to friends. (he has a girlfriend that's why and didn't want me to know) When he did allow me to search him, he was the first one after I typed his name. I didn't see this before.<SEP>How does Facebook guess results when you search for someone?<EOS>

Practically there is no way to fix a muffler.

I would check the "Coolant Level Sensor" first if the cooling system is full of anti-freeze and it is not overheating or showing any signs of leaking!

One thing you should check before you take your car in for an allignment is the tire pressures... A low tire (front or rear) can make your car's steering pull in the direction of the low tire. Check your car owners manual for proper inflation pressures. If that doesn't help, then you need the services of a professional.Adjusting the front end allignment on your car is not a job for a home mechanic.  It requires some rather expensive equipment and technical knowledge to do the job right.  Your local Ford dealer or most area tire shops have the equipment to do the job. I'd suggest taking your car to one of them.<SEP>How do you adjust the alinement on your front wheels of your car? I have a 2000 ford focus LX and it pulls to the left.<EOS>
The way you describe it, I assume you took two very long lengths of chain and tried to throw them over the tree limb, and ending up with 2 hanging lengths of chain on each side of your swing. This is more difficult to get to swing because as you try to swing, one side of the chain fights with the other side. What you need to do is loop the chain over the limb, then you need to attach the end of the chain to a link iin the chainup by the limb, so that a single strand of chain hangs down to your swing. This arrangement would give you 2 strands of chain total hanging from the limb, one for each side of the swing. It should work fine like this.<SEP>How do you make a swing swing from a tree? I have two chains over a limb.  On the chains there is rubber at the top to protect the tree limb.  The problem is now the swing doesn't swing because there is no give at the top.

It is fairly simple.  What you need to do is follow steps that are mentioned below for adding multiple destinations....  From point A to Point B - add the destinations and if needed swap the destinations by dragging the "O" with either mouse+left click hold or the left button+ curser hold and moving.  Once you add the destinations hit anywhere or hit find route  or list all steps for interactive map..  Now to add destination, you can not do on the browser since there is no "+" sign there anymore once you already have activated the route. To add further, go to the map layout in the right pane and click on full map view ....  Once you click on the full map view, the route option with  a "+" will come again in the map browser window. Add the destination and hit list all steps . There you go...  Thanks and enjoy.<SEP>How can I add multiple destinations in new Google Maps?<EOS>
You're going to have to drain the pond.  Then you'll have to have to examen it for cracks, etc. where the leak might be.  You should then either fill the cracks and holes with cement or have someone do it for you.  Lastly, you should put a sealant over the entire surface siince bricks absorb water and detriorate rapidly when kept wet.  The problem you most likely have is that the bricks weren't sealed and they have begun to break down due to continued exposure to the water.<SEP>How can I stop a leak in my brick pond?

Since nobody wants to tell you what to do...I will. Get an oil drain pan. Get 4to 5 quarts of oil and the recommended oil filter. Put the drain pan under the car directly under the oil pan drain plug. Use a six point socket or wrench, And an oil filter wrench that fits your cars oil filter. The six point ones help keep you from stripping the bolt head. If it seems tight bump the wrench in the direction you need to go.with your hand. A bump breaks free bolts that you can't get loose a lot easier. Try not to drop the drain bolt in the drain pan unless you get one that has a catch screen designed to keep things from falling into the oil drain pan. Once the oil has drained. Reinstall the drain plug. Make sure if it has a gasket on it that the gasket is there when you reinstall it... It can be over looked if the gasket fell off the plug..Next. Remove oil filter using the oil filter wrench. Unscrew it and let it drain in the pan. Then physically look at the filter and make sure the rubber gasket is still on the old filter. It is possible for the filter to come off,and the o ring gasket to stay stuck on the engine... This is a big no no. Because if you screw the new filter on with the old gasket in place it's not gonna seal and make a huge mess when you start your car. Now that you know that you don't have the old gasket still on, take the new filter and put a light film of oil on the gasket of the new filter.... You can use new or old oil to put on the gasket..It doesn't matter. Screw new filter on as tight as you can by hand. Then take your filter wrench" and I only say this because your a femal and may not have the hand strenth to get it tight enough with out the tool. And tighten it another1/4 to 1/2 turn. Then just fill it up with oil. Put in 3 quarts and check the dipstick. Then just keep adding oil till the dipstick finally is on the full mark. Then start your vehicle. look under it and see if you have any leaks.... Turn the car off and wait 1 to 2 mins and check the level again. Then just fill as needed till oil on the dipstick where it should be and your done. I was a little too detailed but that's because I'm guessing you've never changed oil in anything before by yourself<SEP>how do i change the oil on my fiesta 1.1 lx?<EOS>
I would agree with the answer calling your local B.B.B  keeping in mind that you get what you pay for.Dealing with pest especially the larger brands(i.e. Rats)can be and is a frustrating and miserable task.First of all be honest with yourself,can you handle taking on the vermin? are you equipped to handle the outcome using pest control agents such as poison,etc.? are you capable of disposing the dead rats after extermination? By using professions who are equipped to handle the above questions are usually followed up with further treatments of the infested areas.If you should decide to take on the task yourself your first task would be to find the Food and Water source of your particular pest.Bait or trap would be the solution to irradication,keep in mind the safety of any pets you may have or children that could access the treated area.I work a ranch and I have to deal with pest invading the feed bins for my horses.Elimination of the food source will be your first move..give a couple days to see if you had any further visits(droppings,fresh foot prints, etc.)If you have, then the proper bait (Poison)can and should be purchased at your local Feed store that caters directly with issues concerning Ranch and Farm Pest and can help you in your choice as to which brand to use.Most of the poisons used are strycnine(sp)based to prevent odor from dead pest.Also if you choose to go the poison route Please keep any pets that you might have (dogs,cats)its not uncommon for dogs to eat dead rats or mice...and before you use baits such as this Please also consider the Natural rat traps that hunt these vermin(owls,Hawks,Eagles)keep check on the areas baited,and look for obvious signs of area use by the pest and proceed accordingly by either application of more poison or the removal of it if your problem has subsided.I quit the poison end of my problem as it worked okay, but it didn't eliminate it...I finally decided to get a couple of cats ...trading 1 pest for another, because cats can and do become a problem also if not kept in check.Its not the cats fault, but the people who owned them and no longer want the responsibility of them, and simply take them for a ride to the country and drop them off..Cats are domestic animals and are not like there counterparts that survive by the hunt.If you live in city,Cats would probably be your best ally, have them 'fixed'and give them love and food, a warm place to sleep, and they will address the rats,Once rats get the message a new 'Sheriff' is in town they soon vacate. I hope this helps and good luck!<SEP>How do I find a reliable exterminator who won't overcharge me? I have been invaded by rats.  My home methods have not worked so well.
