depends what kind of paint.  First, try some rubbing compound that you'd get at autozone to buff it out.  if that doesn't work, try a little bit of laquer thinner, acetone, or paint thinner.

sounds like you have no electricity live in the box. What you have is an interupter wire for the light.Technicly it should be 2 black wires. What it is , is the power wire Black from the light is run through the switch. In your case the electrition just used a standard wire and used the white wire to return power to the light when the switch is on. the bare wire is the ground wire and should be connected to the box, some dimmer switches have no place to connect a ground. In any event you dont have a white common wire, witch you need. the white wire on the switch should be black and a good electrition will use a black sharpie to color it for safty reasons.

A nasty stain or unsightly hole doesn't have to ruin the whole carpet. Patch it.       Steps:  1.   Cut out the entire damaged area with a utility knife. Try to do this with just one cut on each side and avoid cutting through the carpet pad.    2.   Use the cut-out piece as a pattern to cut a new piece. Be sure to match the direction of the pile.    3.   Spread carpet adhesive on the exposed carpet pad and on the back of the patch itself.    4.   Put some adhesive under the edges of the carpet surrounding the hole as well.    5.   Press the patch into the hole and rough up the pile with your fingertips.    6.   Let the glue dry for about six hours and then vacuum the patched area.        Tips:   If you accidentally cut the carpet pad, fasten it down with a piece of wide duct tape.     If you don't happen to have extra matching carpet, get a remnant at a carpet store. Take your damaged piece with you when you go to the store to help you find a good match.     Use a sharp blade in the utility knife for the best cut.  http://www.ehow.com/how_8256_patch-hole-carpet.html<SEP>How to replace a piece of carpet?

Don't call me gave one of the best answers..... I work on these all the time... wash it out with dawn dishliquid and warm water.

DO replace it once a year, no more then 2 years... clean it often in dusty conditions... Though I would like to say, soap and water is cheaper then wasting that gas now...., both do well though..

Generally, the floor joists are 16 or 24 inches on center apart. You take the roll of insulation and unroll it between the joists.

Portable generators are noisy. If you have neighbors nearby or the noise is unbearable in your house here are some ideas. - Choose an operating location as far away as possible. Note that a larger gauge wire is needed to reduce voltage drop as line length increases. Reducing line loss is required to minimize power loss and to ensure maximum power is available to the house. Lights will flicker less when heavy loads are attached. - Change the exhaust system. Noise from the portable generator systems comes primarily from two sources, the engine block and the exhaust system.. With an air cooled engine there is little you can do about block noise. Some engines can have a larger muffler attached or make other changes to the exhaust system. Merely mounting exhaust pipe vertically will noticeably reduce noise. - Build a noise shielding enclosure. This could be as simple as a piece of plywood to reflect sound away from the house to a separate shed to hold the generator. Design your enclosure with safety in mind. Provide adequate air circulation and ventilation to prevent heat buildup and to remove carbon monoxide. - If the noise bothers your neighbors, invite them over for coffee or offer to run line to their home to power the freezer or a few lights. Talk to them before starting the engine, ask they let you know if the noise is bothersome before they phone the police or harbor any resentment. A little diplomacy can go a long way. - Last resort, shut off the engine or buy a quiet generator.<SEP>How do iI make a loud generator more quit?<EOS>

Will depend upon if your leak is at the faucet or the plumbing underneath the sink. "Rebuild" kits for the faucet are available at those large box home improvement stores. You'll need the manufacturer's name and model. Usually they contain the necessary o-rings, washers, etc. to fix most dripping faucets. Worst case is a replacement. You will probably not need any specialized tools, perhaps a hex key of the right size. Just follow the directions. Try to keep a rag between chrome surfaces and your tools to avoid scratching. Make sure you turn off the water, hot and cold, before you start and put a rag in the drain to avoid loosing small parts.The under the sink plumbing can be a bit of a bear depending on the material used. Plastic is really easy. Disassemble the trap (there's about a cup of water in there!) and check for cracks and worn gaskets. Parts are redily available at that same store. Make sure you have the correct size. Again, worse case, replace everything. Large slip joint pliers or a small pipe wrench may be required.In both cases, look for worn, cracked or pieces that have slipped. Generally it is more cost effective to replace gaskets, small pipes, etc. rather than trying to salvage something. The repairs are pretty easy. Go slowly, keep things in order for re-assembly and things should go fine.I make it a practice to ALWAYS WEAR SAFETY GLASSES, even while doing a job like this. Good luck!<SEP>How to fix a leaky sink?

How can I set a Gmail filter that finds email sent âonly to meâ?<SEP>This new answer works if one of the other recipients has a top level domain that is common-ish and different from yours.  Aaron's answer appears not to work, for two reasons.  The first is that google does not implement wild cards in gmail ( Wildcard search in Gmail ). The second reason is that, from experience, I find the search considers BOTH conjuncts, to:me and, say, -to:com .  It's easy to check by entering to:me -to:com in the search bar, and finding that nothing sent to your gmail.com address is there.  From the question I linked above we know that you need to search tokens; e.g., top level domains like .com and .org. But we know we can't just do  to:me to:(-com -org -edu -gov -uk -net -ca -de -jp -fr -au -us -ru -ch -it -nl -se -no -es -mil)  As an aside, don't try and putting ALL top level domains in, as the search will be rejected for length.  I got the above list from This blog post about common TLDs .  There is one more thing to deal with, and that is the empty to: field.  My work around is to use is:important to limit the intrusion of these.  Gmail complained when I tried to make a filter with this flag, but it did properly filter a new (important) email to me.  So, we come to my answer, where my own top level domains are .com and .uk (.ac.uk, but the .uk is a token in itself):  is:important to:((-com OR me) -coop -org -edu -gov (-uk OR me) -net -ca -de -jp -fr -au -us -ru -ch -it -nl -se -no -es -mil)  This enforces the following two properties:  1. Emails to anyone with a listed domain different from yours are rejected  2. If an email has one of your domains, it must be (at least) to you.  In a similar manner, you can add specific email addresses that you commonly receive email together with you by adding something like -<coworker@yourdomain.com><EOS>

As you type in the search box, youâll see relevant results from across all of your files show up below your search.

You've left out a bit of information, such as inground or above, type of equipment etc. I'll post my generic closing guide here for you.Ideally, your closing starts a week before you actually get down to putting the cover on. Get your water balanced chemically first. That week allows you to do this.On closing day: Vac the pool and drain it to just below the pool returns. They are typically the lowest point in the system. When drained to that point, add in a winterizing chemical kit (most pool shops sell them), they typically contain an algaecide, shock and sequestering agent . Remove ladders and rails. You may remove the diving board if you wish, or cover it in opaque plastic sheet and secure it. If you totally remove it,  place something over the diving board jig bolts and lube those bolts or tape with duct tape that jut up through the deck. This can prevent stubbed toes and saves the jig bolts from corrosion.You're done at the pool for the moment. Head over to your pool equipment. If this is a sand filtered pool, you ought to have done a backwash, during the draining process, to clean out the filter. If a D.E. pool, then the same applies to clean off the elements. You can remove them later for a thorough cleaning. If a cartridge filter, just remove the cartridge and clean at your leisure.For all filter types, there will be a drain plug, remove it and keep it out.Over to the pump. All inground pumps will have 2 plugs, one midway back on one side and one directly in front.All above ground pumps have a single one, located at the front, under the impellor housing. Remove them and place them in the pump basket along with your filter drain plug. It's a nice , safe place, that you won't lose them in, as you'll leave the pump basket right where it is. This next part all depends on your pool plumbing, you'll have to decide the best route as they are all plumbed differently and the many different ways to blow out lines would be a book unto itself. You'll need to tap into both the return and the suction lines. Typically for the returns, you disconnect a line between your filter and heater (if equipped) and for the suction, you can go directly in from the front of the pump, without disconnecting anything. Doing it this way, will allow you to blow all the water out of the heater, pool returns, any waterfall or fountain(if equipped) or attached spa. Same goes for the suction line for skimmer, in wall suction for a pool cleaner and attached spa suctions (if equipped). You can rent a line blower from a rent all or your local pool shop, or you can use a medium sized shop vac that has a blow feature. The shop vac hose is actually the same diameter as the inside diameter of most pool plumbing (1 1/2 inch) so it makes a good fit. Blow out the lines, until you only see a tiny dribble at the pool, both suction and return. Charge the line with plumber's antifreeze (not automotive) and blow that through to the pool, for all lines. When you see the dye colour of the antifreeze at the pool, it means that the antifreeze protection is sufficient. Plug with your telflon taped winter plugs, all lines ending at the pool. Put something squishable (empty chemical containers or an old partially filled inner tube) into the skimmer to protect it from freeze damage. Remove the pressure guages from the filter and put them in the pump basket with your equipment plugs.There are 3 basic types of pool heater, electric, gas and solar. You don't mention which you have, so I'll assume if you do have one, it's gas. Open the drain cocks on both sides of the heater header (you blew out all the water , when doing the lines, should just be a little anti freeze that dribbles out) and disconnect the pressure switch from it's compression fitting. No need to store it, just let it hang from it's electrical wires. Turn off both the gas valve on the interior and the gas feed line going to the heater.

Downloading auto-generated YouTube transcriptions<SEP>There are a couple of ways to extract subtitles from a YouTube video -  By specifying the language and VideoId in this generic URL - http://www.youtube.com/api/timedtext?lang={LANG}&v={VIDEOID} you can get an .xml file containing the subtitles in the desired language for a chosen video.

Use an everyday spray bottle and spray water on the popcorn.  Start in a small section in the most hidden corner of the room becasue there is a slight learning curve to this.  Once you spray and saturate the popcorn, use a putty knife (1" in detail areas, up to 6" in large areas) and attempt to scrape off the popcorn.  DO NOT OVERWET OR OVERSCRAPE AT FIRST! Start with minimal water and scraping and increase from there.  The goal is to scrape off the texture (popcorn) and not the drywall paper (if it is in fact drywall behind it, some older homes may have a different backing than drywall). Make sure you wear eye protection and something to prevent you from inhaling the dust and/or particles.  This is a VERY messy process, so make sure you cover everything below with a heavy plastic drop-cloth, which can be purchased at any home improvement store.<SEP>how to remove popcorn ceiling?<EOS>

There is no known flexible chimney liner that I would recommend if you are burning wood, a chimney fire can reach 1700-2000 degrees. Only rigid ceramic or thick SS can stand up to that. However if you are venting something at a lower temp, you might use flexible SS tubing, it has rings, but take it from me, don't.

You must buy a rear-brake rotating tool. (I'm not sure of the technical name) It screws the pistons in instead of pushing them in. Make sure the pistons screw in freely and make sure the e-brake mechanism is functioning properly. These calipers are notorious for seizing and having e-brake problems, in turn causing accelerated wear. My honest opinion, if you must ask how to do it, you probably shouldn't be doing the brakes on your car. The 2 most important things on a car are tires and brakes. If you screw it up, you could end up killing poeple. Please seek professional help if there is any doubt as to what you doing.

With just retiring one of these with nearly 200K miles, I experienced similar problem.  It was the coil.  It would start, idle rough, then die.

You can remove, I believe, 9 10mm bolts from the cover on the left side of the engine and expose the belt.  Make sure it is in tact.  If it is, pull that cover all the way out.

Several methods here depending on the size of the hole. Smaller holes can be patched with pre-mixed sheet rock mud. Sounds like youve got a bigger problem. If the hole is really big, cut the sheetrock so that the hole is rectangular. Cut, from a new piece of sheet rock you got from your favorite home improvement center, a "patch" that is approximately 1" bigger than the hole on all four sides. Use construction adhesive to glue the patch from the backside into the hole. You may need to hold this patch in place with sheetrock screws around the edges. When that's dry (give it some time!) cut another piece that just fits the hole, about an 1/8" smaller on all sides. Glue that over the backing you put in. Let that dry. Use sheetrock tape and mud to finish off the seams. Sand, texture and paint to match. This isn't a difficult project. You need a sharp knife, straight edge, some sheetrock, sheetrock mud, sheetrock tape, construction adhesive, sheetrock screws, screw driver, canned texture, sand paper, paint and a 4" - 6" putty knife. Let everything dry before moving on to the next step.<SEP>how do i repair a large hole in drywall?  what tools should i use?<EOS>
