How do I add a caption to an image in Google Documents?<SEP>As of October 25, 2013, Google Documents does not support text wrapping around tables, so inserting a table and putting an image and a caption in it will work but cannot be made to have text wrapped around it.  One workaround is that since text can wrap around images, we can choose Insert > Drawing... and create a drawing with the text we want to caption the image with.  The resulting drawing can be changed to have text wrapped around it, and can then be placed beneath the image we inserted.<EOS>

If you are looking at your gas meter, you should see four dials straight in a row. Pay close attention to the numbers on the dial and the rotation of the pointer. The first dial should be read counterclockwise. Record the number the pointer has just passed. For example, if the pointer is between the number 4 and the number 5, for dial one, the number would be 4 (counterclockwise dial, the number the pointer just passed). The second dial should be read clockwise. Record the number the pointer just passed. For example, if the pointer is between the number five and the number 6, for dial number two, the number would be 5. The third dial is read exactly like the first, counterclockwise and the number the pointer has just passed. The fourth dial is read clockwise, but this time record the number the pointer is nearest. To determine how much gas you have consumed this month, record your meter reading today. Then come back one month from today and record your meter reading again. Then subtract last's months reading from this month's reading to calculate how many ccf's of gas you've used.<SEP>how do you read a natural gas meter?<EOS>

If you must open the windows, not just want to see if they open, you can cut the paint seal along the sash or sides of the window with a knife.  Then cut the seal at the top and bottom of the window.  Insert a chisel under the bottom of the window, and as you force the chisel in, the window will break the seal, and move upwards.If you have windows that seal below the sill, take a hammer, and a piece of wood, and a cloth.  Put the cloth on top of the piece of wood.  Place the cloth/wood against the inside of the upper frame of the window that you want to raise, and tap upwards on the wood with the hammer.

Wow, I just did this last weekend!  If it's floor tile, the easiest way to do it is to use a dremel with a tile bit.  It only took me about an hour to do my whole kitchen floor.  I just had the dremel in one hand and the shop vac in the other and ran the bit down the grout lines and it drilled it all out.  I just set my depth for the bit about 1/4" let the tile be my guide as I had the bit touching the edge of one tile during the first pass and the edge of the other tile on the way back through that line.  I was worried about it chipping the tile, but it didn't...maybe I got lucky...use at your own risk.  The second way which I started out doing and it took forever was to use a grout saw it's like a screwdriver with a saw blade on the end of it shaped like a blade you put in a utility knife but with teeth and just saw out the grout.  Just start sawing along a tile edge, then saw the edge on the other tile, then break out the grout between the saw lines and suck it all up with the shop vac.  I spent $10 on the grout saw and $8 on the dremel bit (actually made by rotozip but it fits in a dremel) at Home Depot.  If you have a dremel, I'd definately suggest using it for a floor, for a wall I'd CAREFULLY try the dremel bit but probably recommend the saw.<SEP>how do i remove grout from between tiles?<EOS>

Corian counter tops are made of material that is the same, all the way thru... so... to eliminate cuts, scratches, etc... some light sanding is all that is required.

The obvious answer for me is to shift the car into neutral and then use the brakes.  Brake pad replacement is one heck of a lot cheaper than a clutch replacement and that's not the only thing that wears on on the transmission!Everytime you shift gears you exercise the syncromesh  associated with each forward gear.  Reverse generally doesn't need any such syncromesh which is why sometimes it is difficult to get into reverse.The clutch throw-out bearing is given a large break too when you leave that clutch pedal out as much as possible.  In that possition the throw-out bearing is not being used.  Held down to the floor, the throw-out bearing is working it's tail off!When the transmission is in neutral the engine speed decreases to idle speed, around 800 rpm.  At that point I am using very little fuel while the ground under the tires is still passing under the car pretty quickly.  That translates to fuel economy!  A quick kick up in rpm and I can put it in any gear I want.The only reason I can give for downshifting through your deceleration is to gain the capacity for a quick acceleration.  That is easily solved with some defensive driving techniques and it really isn't that slow shifting into whatever gear I want when I need it anyway!My '90 Honda Prelude has 230,000 miles on it's original clutch!  The only thing that has been replaced is the clutch acutation parts since that is controlled by hydraulics with a master and a slave cylinder similar to the brake system.<SEP>How do you stop when you drive manual transmission car?

Subsurface leak detection equipment.  U can't go by where the water shows up.  It seeks the past of least resistance & can show up 50' from the leak.  When I locate leaks I use an air compressor hooked to the boiler drain to the washer or the outside hosebib.  The air is easier to hear than water.  Sometimes if you put your ear to tha slab you can hear the air gurgling coming out of the pipe.

Then, there's the Fuel System. Is there Someone that You can Talk to that You can Trust that's done this before, for Advice? This is a Serious Repair that has to be Done Right the First Time! If not, the entire Engine could be Destroyed, and, since it's a Throttle Body System that utilizes High Pressure Fuel, if not Done Properly, a Fire could Result! Look, I Know You want to Save $ome Money, because a Garage is going to Charge Several Hundred Dollars to do the Job. If You do Take it to a Shop, Clean Up all of the Parts First, including all the Bolts, Nuts, Brackets, Pulleys, Etc. That will make a Big Difference in Price.

Mr. plevine, you first have to determine whether your system uses R-12 or R134a before servicing or troubleshooting it. How do you know whether the system in your vehicle uses R-12 or R-134a? LOOK FOR SPECIAL INDENRIFICATION DECALS OR LABELS ON THE MAJOR COMPONENTS.What else should you look for? The high-side low-side service fittings on an R-134a system are completely different from those used on an R-12 system.On an R-12 system, the high-side service fitting is a 3/8-inch 24 for screw-on couplers; the low-side fitting is a 7/16inch 20 (also known as 1/4-inch flare fitting) On an R-134a system, the high-side and low-seide service fittings are special 1/2-inch Acme-type fittings with no external threads. They have internal threads, but they're for the specially-designed caps unique to R134a fittings. Mr. plevine look for a RED-CAP for high-side BLUE-CAP for the low-side. Be mighty-careful when you service airconditioning system.GOOD LUCK!<SEP>How do i find my low pressure line on my  98 buick park ave a/c system?<EOS>
If you already have a phone jack in the back of your computer, then the above user is correct.  If you do not, there may be several approaches to solving your problem.First you need a modem.  If you want to use the computer to answer the phone, save and play voice mail, etc. then all you need is a data/fax/voice modem.  They are installed as a PCI card in an available slot in your computer, and provide a phone jack for the physical connection.  They usually include software for sending and receiving faxes, voicemail, and receiving and making voice calls.  You will need a microphone and speakers, or headset (easier to use)Here is an example of a PCI fax/data/voice modem: http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=50179302&pfp=BROWSEIf you want to connect your phone line to your computer for internet access, a PCI fax/data/voice modem will work, but is very slow.  You can also connect to the internet via your phone using a DSL modem.  DSL uses wires in your phone line but does not prevent you from making or receiving calls on your house line.  DSL is also much faster than "dial-up" internet access using the PCI fax/data/voice modem.For connecting a DSL modem, you will need a 10/100 Ethernet PCI card instead of the PCI fax/data/voice modem.Well, I hope this helps.  There may be other ways to do this, such as Modems with USB connections, etc.  but i am not sure about those.Good Luck.-Neil<SEP>how do you hook up or phone to your computer?<EOS>
Sorry, but no.There is simply too much to try to explain here, and too many details. Illustrations are needed.If money is the only issue, go to the library, and in the REFERENCE section, check their repair manuals. They won't let you check it out, but you can certainly read it there and take notes. Be careful about photocopying. COPYRIGHTS you know.While you are there, ask if they subscribe to Mitchell On-Demand or ALLDATA. Both are very good references, professional level and will have every detail available, including illustrations, and it has a PRINT feature.Really good stuff.If you can pony up $20.00, you can purchase a repair manual for the little car at the parts store, book store, Amazon, BN.com or ????Good Luck and Merry Christmas<SEP>How to remove door panel from 95 Accord to move window?

You need to list what part of the emission test is not passing. Is it excessive CO? Excessive NOx? Or excessive Hydrocarbons? Each has a different reason for causing the failure.Excessive CO means you're lacking oxygen for complete combustion. Check the air cleaner and air intake.Excessive Hydrocarbons means too much fuel or poor combustion. Check Fuel injectors to be sure they aren't sticking, Spark plugs.Excessive NOx means combustion is too hot. You've got various ways to reduce NOx emissions. Typically a variable valve systems will automatically minimize NOx emissions which I believe the CRX has. However if there is a PCV valve, EGR Valve I'd check theses first.<SEP>How do I get my car to pass emissions? My Honda CRX will not pass the Washington emission test, and I have brought it through about three times.

Link to specific sheet in Google spreadsheet<SEP>When you switch to a different sheet in Google Spreadsheets, pay attention to the URL in your browser's address bar.

After a second or two a new menu, Tasks , will appear after Help . There is one item in this menu: Go to sheet...   This menu item will open a panel with a list of names of all the sheets in the current spreadsheet.

First, if you ran out of oil it is possible you MAY have drawn some sludge into the line and clogged the orifice (nozzle) in the burner. It must be cleaned or replaced. Unless you're a good mechanic AND you know what you're doing let a serviceman do it.MORE  LIKELY,  if you did draw sludge from your tank into the supply line it may very well have 'gummed up' the in-line filter (if you have one) - most systems do. You MAY have to replace the filter element and,  if you do replace it,  fill the canister and filter assembly with fuel oil before reassembling it. This is the best way to prime the line and it saves a lot of bleeding time and by not having the canister filled you may not be able to completely bleed the system. Sounds like either a clogged filter (most likely) or a clogged nozzle(orifice) or BOTH!  One other thing - if you know when your oil deliveries are scheduled make an effort to have someone home and have them turn off the emergency shut-off switch (usually a red wallplate) prior to the delivery. Leave it off for 2 hours or so before turning it back on. The reason? When oil is pumped into the tank it stirs up the 'gunk and junk' which has settled to the bottom of the tank and this 'stuff' stays suspended in the oil for some time after the delivery. By not running the oil burner for several hours you give the 'gunk' a chance to settle back to the bottom of the tank and not be pulled into the supply line where it does its dirty deeds.Good luck!<SEP>how do i prime my oil burner/furnace? i recently ran out of oil in my oil burner/furnace, and now that the thing is full again it won't turn back on. i've already tried bleeding the thing and that doesn't work. where i live it is very cold and i need help fast!!!<EOS>
Is there a webapp to create ASCII art tables? [closed]<SEP>Since the OP specifically says:   It doesn't have to use ASCII (it can be Unicode)   I thought I'd share the link for the (mysql / unicode / html) table generator created by a SE user for use on SE I found on superuser . I found it quite useful to get unicode tables (which I sometimes prefer over the Windows-1252 compatible "ASCII" art). And this tool lets you compare the outputs, as well as getting a HTML formatted table, too.  Example to show my workflow: I'm making a web app for my bookkeeper to calculate sales tax and I am doing math on months and quarters so that the tool always automatically displays "last quarter's sales tax info" . Since  I'm always thinking of arrays starting with 0, I needed to embed a simple table outlining the months in each quarter to keep the values sorted in my head.  1) To get the table started, I used this generator (listed on both this and the other QA) with its Excel-like input interface to actually create the data, as the unicode tool wants pre-formatted text. I type in the values then select them and CTRL-C to get my tab delimited table:  Quarter Numbers Names Q1  1, 2, 3 Jan, Feb, Mar Q2  4, 5, 6 Apr, May, Jun Q3  7, 8, 9 Jul, Aug, Sep Q4  10, 11, 12  Oct, Nov, Dec  2) went to senseful's generator and pasted into the input area. I played with each of the 3 options and I liked the Unicode Art option the best:  ╔═════════╦════════════╦═══════════════╗ ║ Quarter ║  Numbers   ║     Names     ║ ╠═════════╬════════════╬═══════════════╣ ║ Q1      ║ 1, 2, 3    ║ Jan, Feb, Mar ║ ║ Q2      ║ 4, 5, 6    ║ Apr, May, Jun ║ ║ Q3      ║ 7, 8, 9    ║ Jul, Aug, Sep ║ ║ Q4      ║ 10, 11, 12 ║ Oct, Nov, Dec ║ ╚═════════╩════════════╩═══════════════╝  Note that for the table to show up correctly on a web page, the character set must be specifically set for UTF-8:  <meta content='text/html; charset=UTF-8' http-equiv='Content-Type'/><EOS>
