Your problem is the main drain and NOT the P-Trap. If it was only the P-trap then the neighbor wouldn't be having a problem. Both your drains may meet behind the wall before they go into the drain pipe. If that's the case there may be a problem behind the wall and that is the landlords problem. Unless you want what you dropped down I wouldn't worry about taking apart your p-trap. The landlord should send someone to the roof to drop a snake down the drain vent and remove the clog. Should you want to remove the p-trap you will need an adjustable wrench to remove the two nuts that hold it in place. You may want to go to a home store or plumbers shop and buy another p-trap if it looks nasty because it might fall apart when you try to remove the nuts. You will need an 11/2" for the kitchen and 1 1/4 for a bathroom. BE AWARE THAT WHEN YOU REMOVE IT ALL THE WATER THAT IS BACKED UP INTO THE DRAIN PIPE IS GOING TO START GUSHING OUT OF THE PIPE. HAVE A BUCKET READY!!!!!!!<SEP>How do I replace/ or clear a clogged drain trap, Please!!? I have dropped a couple of items down my drain & My landlord's worker tried to fix it a couple of years ago but did'nt succeed.

I live upstairs & the lady in  the apt. next to me is having problems with hers also, (I assuume because we share a common pipe, which is past our seperate drains. According to our leases we are responsible for the plumbing bill if we caused the problem!! Neither she nor I can afford large plumbing expense.  I was told by a friend that since the trap is metal (galvinized) it would be easy to repacel due to the fact that it is not only clogged but  also probably quite corroded.  She informed me that it  not a difficutl task  you just must use caution !!I understand, with that said, her son was going to try to use a "Shop Vac" & plastic tubing to try to suck out the objects down there. but I don't know if that would be sufficient ,because I believe some has gone past the trap!!!<EOS>
I've been in the "business for 25 years" and have installed hundreds of square feet of this. The former installer did not leave the proper space in the installation process, there should have been a gap left under the trim mold on the sides for expansion.

Is the floor glued down, this is the big question, if it is, Ooops! I don't know what you can do and keep the looks.

There are several sources for car history- State DMVs.  Very slow to respond.  They only have details on registrations and brands - when a car has major damage a brand is added.  Also, they will only have data for one state - if the car has moved they can't help you.  Fees vary by state.  The best source is Carfax.

1.   Pour cola on the oily or dry stained areas, and leave the cola on overnight. Squirt a generous amount of dishwashing liquid into a bucket until you have a good lather. Rinse with the soapy water, then with a garden hose.    2.   Sprinkle baking soda or an absorbent powder such as cornmeal or sawdust on the oily spots. If the stain is dry, wet it first to make a scouring paste. Scrub with a stiff brush or push broom.    3.   Sprinkle automatic dishwasher detergent on the oily concrete. Leave it for several minutes, then pour boiling water on the stained area. Scrub with a stiff brush or push broom, then rinse.    4.   Try a commercial concrete cleaner such as Garage and Driveway Cleaner by Red Devil Co. or a grease solvent such as Benzine. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.    5.   Sprinkle trisodium phosphate (TSP) on the oily concrete. If the stain is dry, wet it first. Let it stand for 30 minutes. Scrub using a stiff broom. TSP is a dangerous product; if you must use it, wear rubber or latex gloves, safety goggles and protective clothing. Also, never wash a TSP product down storm drains.    6.   As a last resort, combat tough spills with muriatic acid and a pressure washer. Apply the acid following the manufacturer's directions, and let it soak for several seconds. Follow with a pressure washer set at 2,500 to 3,000 lbs. per square inch (psi), or 176 to 211 kg per square cm. Like TSP, muriatic acid is a dangerous product; likewise, if you must use it, wear rubber or latex gloves, safety goggles and protective clothing, and never wash such a product down storm drains.    7.   After trying any of the strategies above, sprinkle baking soda over the cleaned area to neutralize the solution you've used.<SEP>How do I remove oil stains from driveway?<EOS>

We get wasp nests all the time under our eaves. Go to a hardware store and pickup wasp and hornet spray. The less expensive kind works just as well at the pricier version (I've done a side by side comparison).Wear goggles if the eaves are really high up so the spray doesn't get in your eyes, otherwise it's not necessary.Wait till early morning somewhere between 2:30 am -6:00 am when it's very dark outside to spray. Have a pole/broomstick handle and plastic handy. Aim a steady stream at the nest until no more wasps fall out of th nest usually 3 min depending on the size of the nest. Golf ball sized nests are small in my book.Wait a few minutes and knock down the nest. The stem is slightly sticky so it takes some force. Wrap it up in a bag and throw away.<SEP>How to get rid of a wasp nest? I have a wasp nest in my shed, its as small as a golf ball right now but its geting biger.<EOS>

4.0 liter probably doesnt have a belt tensioner.  Most 4 liter dodge engines you have to loosen the idler pully and then the screw on top of the idler pully screws the idler down when you loosen it.  I could be wrong but I know that most 4 liters i have done are this way no tensioner just an idler pully that slides down when you loosen it. If it does have a tensioner then you should be able to use a 1/4 in ratchet.  Insert into the hole on the end of the tensioner and pull back.  I wrote to someone before about how to change a belt on a jeep.  This is what I said.  not that easy there is no tensioner on a 4.0 liter. First you need a 15mm socket. There is a idler pully on the drivers side of engine in front of teh power steering pump. Loosen the bolt in the center of the pully. Do not take all the way out just loosen a few turns. Then once you have the idler loose you need a 13mm socket and extension. Look down on the back side of the idler kind of on top. THere is a bolt that is about 4 inches long that goes down through the back of the pully. Loosen that bolt and the idler pully will slide down taking tensioin off the belt. Do this until you fel the belt is loose enough to remove. Once you have the belt off put new belt back on follow the diagram on the sticker under the hood. Follow the steps in reverse order to tighten. First tighten the bolt until the belt can be twisted about 1/4 to 1/2 side to side. once the belt is tight enough go ahead and tighten the nut on the idler pully and your done. Before you start it is helpfull to look at the bolt on the back and look where the threads are this helps you to get correct tension. also make sure you have the sticker for the diagram under the hood before you start. If you sont make sure you draw the belt or get one. It can be a pain to put back if you have no diagram. Well sorry so long but wanted to be specific. Good luck.<SEP>How do I release the tensioner for the serpentine belt on a jeep? 2001 Jeep Wrangler with 4.0 liter engine.

Make sure the power is on to the furnace or blower coil. That powers up the t-stat and makes the system work. An easy check is to flip the fan on/auto switch to on and see if the fan comes on. If it does, then the power is on to the furnace. Next try is to go outside and have someone flip the t-stat up and down. you should hear a clicking noise in the condenser outside.

the regulator is attached to the alternator.  to replace just that you need to first find a regulator, which most parts stores will not have.  it is more cost effective to replace the entire unit.At worst a regulator would have to be ordered, but you never know what a parts store might have, however, it is an isuzu, parts aren't readily available.on the alternator there will be at least 2 wires/plugs.  one is a threaded bolt, that is the alternator output.  the other is usually a plastic connector with 2-5 wires, that's where the regulator plugs in.  sometimes the entire alternator has to be dismantled to get to it, others just unscrew off the backside.<SEP>how to change the voltage regulator on a 87 isuzu trooper II?  where is it locate on the isuzu ?

Before any adjusting of the carb you must correct your timing by using a timing light. Crawl under the car with the car in park and the hot wire off the ignition, and have friend bump the ignition. With a flash light you should be able to see a groove on the harmonic balancer. Take a piece of soap stone or chalk and define this groove. With this done reconnect the hot wire to the distributor. Hook the timing light up to the battery and to the no. 1 plug wire. Now you are ready to check your timing. with the car running remove the vacuum advance line to the distributor and adjust the timing by turning the distributor to bring the timing mark to 8-14 degrees BTDC (Before Top Dead Center) this should get you in the ballpark for carb adjustment.There is not that much adjustments that can be made to a Q-Jet. The only one are the air and fuel mixture screws at the front of the carb. This takes allot of trial and error before you get good at this. If you turn the screws till you have your best idle you should be fine. That's what I do. don't forget to hook your vacuum advance line back up before making carb adjustments.<SEP>how do I adjust the fuel intake on my quadrajet carburetor?

You need to determine if the drywall has been cracked or compromised in any way.  If it has it might not be a simple matter of spackling. You may need to cut a hole square and then shave about a third of the drywall off around it.  Then get a piece of screen, like from an old screen door, cut it to fit the shaved area, and then spackle it in.  Be sure to apply a little spackling before you put the screen in so it has something to stick to from the back as well as the front.  Then wait until the spackling dries and add another layer. Lat that dry as well.  Keep adding successive layers and letting them dry until the spackling is roughly flush with the surrounding surface area.  Then you need to take some 200 grit sandpaper and sand the dried spackling until it's as smooth as it can be and there is very little if any differentiation between the spackled area and the surrounding area.   If you don't think your drywall has been cracked or compromised just forego cutting a hole and add successive layers of spackling.  Let it dry and then paint over it.<SEP>How do you Spackle a wall that has pieces of dry wall missing from slight water damage? -water leak is fixed-want to paint but need to fix the wall first-there is not a hole just some of the outside surface is worn away on the wallplease help<EOS>

Goo Gone is a fantastic product (available at Target and most any hardware store or drug store) and works amazingly well on even pesky sticker residue.  Soak the area, and wipe it away.  It might take repeated applications, but you can remove the sticker without scratching, and without leaving a gooey residue.Note that Goo Gone can affect some surfaces, including some plastics, so you should be careful, especially if it is clear plastic.  I've used Goo Gone many times on plastic glassic and CD cases, so it will certainly work on many plastics, but you should be careful. In the event that Goo Gone seems too risky, you can frequently remove just the adhesive residue using plain old Scotch tape.  Remove as much of the sticker as possible (the paper/plastic backing) and then apply tape to the sticker residue firmly.  Pull the tape off sharply, and some of the residue will come with it.  This is a slow process so only do it if the area is relatively small, however, I frequently use this tactic for price tags and the like and it is surprisingly effective.<SEP>How do I get a sticker off of a car window  (plastic part)?

Rear brakes can be a pain, especially if they're drum brakes and not disc.  First thing to do would be to go out and get a Hayne's Manual for your car and it's year.  This book will cover the brakes specifically for your car, and will include pictures, step by step, and the reassembly.  They also make a Brake Manual that covers all kinds of brakes.  It's a little more detaild and includes even more pictures.  Both books can be found at any auto parts store and are normally only $15.  Disc brakes should require no more than a socket set and maybe some allen wrenches.  It's normally only two bolts on the caliper.  Drum brakes will require some specialized tools, but they're very inexpensive.  If you've never done it before, drum brakes work with multiple springs on the inside that have to be replaced in specific order.  You will need to give yourself some time to figure it out, and even better, a camera to take a picture of the other side (it gets old running back and forth to make sure you're doing it right since you'll be doing one wheel at a time; obviously one will still be assembled).  The books will help a lot though.Disc brakes can take as little as 15 minutes to replace, drums as much as a whole day.<SEP>how to install rear brakes on 1993 mazda 929?<EOS>
Take off the rear wheels. Do one side at a time in case you need to check how everything goes back together. Slide the drum off. If the drum has deep scratches in it, then take it somewhere to get machined or buy a new one for about $25. Use a brake spring removal tool (available at Sears, etc) to remove the shoe hold down springs and clips.  Remove the old shoes and put on the new brake shoes. Reattach the springs using the brake tool.  New brake shoes by Wagner are about $15 and $25 from Motorcraft.  Replace any hold down clips or springs that are broken, bent up, etc.  Look at the brake on the other side of the car to see how everthing goes back together.<SEP>how do you replace back brake shoes on a 1993 ford lightning F150 pick up?<EOS>

Gmail backups have become a somewhat timely topic, as thousands of Gmail users had their account reseted by accident recently.  Here's one more backup solution from the comments to that Engadget post:   I have all my GMail emails forwarded to my Hotmail account, of which all of the emails are downloaded locally on 2 different computers. I've had my Hotmail account since 1998, and I've never lost anything or had a problem so if GMail goes down, Hotmail will still work, and if that goes down, I have it all backed up.

Look for a radiator drain spigot usually on the bottom driver's side of the radiator. Once the engine has cooled, take the radiator cap off and open the drain spigot. About 1-2 gallons drain out into your drain pan which you store in a used plastic container for toxic substance disposal at your local land fill facility. Now close the drain spigot and fill the radiator with distilled water. Put the radiator cap back on and drive the car for at least 30 minutes with the heater on full. Repeat the same procedure after the engine has cooled, driving the car again for another 30 minutes or so. The idea is to dilute the antifreeze concentration in the coolant system to the point that it's mostly distilled water. Finally, empty the radiator one last time and fill it with a 100% concentration of antifreeze. That will give you a 50/50 concentration of new antifreeze since about half of the coolant system capacity is in the radiator and half is in the engine and heater core etc. Run the engine at idle until the thermostat opens and all air is bled out the radiator cap opening. Keep topping off the radiator to keep it full. Put the radiator cap back on and the job is done. You can flush the overflow coolant tank with a garden hose.<SEP>how do I change the coolant on a 1995 Ford windstar?<EOS>

on the pipe thinggie is called the stem. past the stem is a nut you need a deep socket to undo this. this will take out the valve body assembley . at the end of the assembley there is a washer. you can buy new valve stems and washers at store. if the valve stem assembly is leaking replace it. while it is out look at the seat of the tap. the flat area of the tap inside the hole is it corroded? if it is start looking at getting a new tap set or something to recut your seat. as it will keep chewing up washers otherwise or see if they are replace able. if the tap set is moen then you might just have to pull the tap valve out and take to store and they will replace for free.(pull with vice grips and becareful not to slip and hurt  yourself)<SEP>How do I fix my leaky shower faucet?

There are two typical non-utility sources:1. the ground around your house does not shed water away from the foundation.2. the groundwater table is high.I have found that most instances the problem is the first one.  Usually the least expensive method to be re-grading the yard to keep water away from the house.  Occasionally you may need to excavate to the foundation slab, and apply a good waterproofing such as an asphalt compound. Customarily, home builders throw trash, such as lunch litter and wood scraps, along the foundation walls before the backfill is placed.  In addition to natural settlement of the ground around a home, when the trash decays, or collapses, the ground settles further.  When gutters overflow, this area holds water which can easily get inside unless the walls were waterproofed to swimmingpool standards.I recommend pulling back the top 4-6" of soil from around the house by as much as 6 - 8 feet out.  Get some clay soil and place a wedge of it with the thickest part near the house. Pack the clay down good. Then re-grade the top soil back, and plant. the end result will be that the ground around the foundation is higher than the remainder of the yard.  It will also be important to have the yard graded to get positive drainage moving the rainwater further away. A Landscape Architect can help you with this.  Then be sure to get the down-spouts pointed away from the house.<SEP>how do i stop water from seeping into my basement?<EOS>

The active ingredient in almost every Nail Polsih Remover is acetone, it has a very low vapor pressure and so it evaporates almost instantly from the surface to which it is applied.  A better solvent for this task is Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), it has a higher vapor pressure than the Acetone so it works on the Cyanoacrylate (super glue) for a longer period of time.  If the countertop that you spilled the CA (Cyanoacrylate) on is a solid surface countertop like Corian you might have problems since it is another acrylic resin that could be dissolved by the MEK.  For the sake of Saving possibly thousands of $'s, please, please, please test the MEK on an inconspicuos area first.  If it dissolves the countertop material, follow the other suggestion and degrade the CA by placing a terry cloth rag over the top of the spill and pouring hot (not boiling) water over it.  Water slowly breaks down the CA and the increased heat will accelerate the process.<SEP>How do I remove super glue from kitchen counter? I have tried nail polish remover and it does not work.?<EOS>

When the pump system is water logged, you have lost the capacity in the tank itself. One way to check it is look for a "water line" on the tank if it is a metal tank. If the ater is cold enough, you will see condensation form at the level of the water. If it is a fiberglass tank, let the pump pump up to pressure and shut off. Make sure nothing is using water in the house or building. Get a 5 gallon bucket and put it under a faucet and open the faucet. Count the gallons it takes before the pump comes back on. If the pump comes on immediately, the system is definitely water logged. Most tanks have a 5 to 20 gallon drawn down gallons, or the gallons that it puts out before the pump comes back on. To "un-water log" the tank, drain the tank down all the way and fill it back up. The pump should add air to the tank as it pumps. The is also some kind of air volumn control either on the tank or in the well piping. Make sure it is working properly and letting air out or adding air, depending on the style of control. Hope this helps! Good luck!<SEP>How do you tell if your water tank is water logged and what are the symptoms of the water well pump if this oc<EOS>

hey bud you need to be a little more specific such as how do you install switched receptacles or how do you switch something pluged to a recepticle or if its new or old instillation.... but i am guessing that you want to know how to switch a recepticle... there is a tab on eather side if you want to keep top always hot and switch bottom brake the tab on the sides between the darker terminals if you want the hole thing switchable then keep tabs intact.. now here is your options you can run 12/3 with ground or 12/2 with ground. if you are running switched/hot combination you will need the 12/3 with ground.... tie the black before the switch in to the incomeing power,    then take a small piece of wire and wire nut the small piece to the incomeing line and hook it to the switch, hook the red to the other side of the switch...  tie all the whites and grounds together..... run to receptacle....on the darker screws hook black to the top red to the bottom (red is switched) .... and hook the white to the recepticle.... if you want to switch the hole thing... forgit about breaking tabs just hook incomeing black to switch tie whites together and grounds put outgoing black on the other screw of the switch... run to recepticle black to darker white to lighter ground it and go....KEEP in mind check the amperage that the switch was ment to hold EX. 15A,20A sw.  or more if needed (buy the 20 for most applications)take a look at this...
