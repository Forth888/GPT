In order to gain access to the spark plugs on a 2000 Alero, you must remove the cover on top of the engine that has the engine size. The cover is like a faux valve cover, once you pull it off, you can easily gain access to the spark plugs.You don't need to take off any cover if it's the 3.4 (3400). Look directly behind the radiator and you will see three wires going to the plugs. The other three are located behind the engine in the same location as the front. Just follow the wires and you'll do fine <SEP> How do I change the spark plugs on a 2000 Oldsmobile Alero? <EOS>

The problem is probably either close to where the wire enters the house foundation or where it connects at the well head. Make sure your testing correctly.If the house was built within the last 5 years, the back fill around the foundation has settled and put a lot of strain on the wire as well as the water pipe coming from the well. I would dig down 4 feet at the outside wall where the wire enters the foundation wall. However it's hard to believe that 12/2 Romex type wire would suffer enough tension force to break. Usually it's the water pipe that breaks at the wall and springs a leak. I'd recheck the voltage at the well head. <SEP> How can I find a break in an buried electrical wire without digging it all up?

Hi, you dont need it completely free of the old sealent. Just scrape off as much as you can and get it reasonable flat, doesn't have to be perfect.

NO!Dear god no, use gas! If you don't use gas you'll break it if the seal is very old and solid. Believe me I know here, I deal in irreplaceable glass all of the time. If I were to break it, there is no going to the glass shop and getting another!The sealer is a rubber, and rubber breaks down with petrol. It takes some time, maybe even a whole day if it's totally solid, but man it helps, helps a lot. Makes the sealer gooey again. Just get a squirt bottle and keep squirting the seals with fuel and keep it wet for as long as possible. You can feel with your fingernail that it's starting to get softer. Best thing about it is, it has zero effect on the inner safety lining of the glass.

There are lots of functions on a VOM, but you will use the AC and DC voltage, ohm, and continuity funtctions most often.  The voltage funtions will tell you if a part is getting power and what that voltage is.  The Ohm funtions tell you the reistance of sensors or other aparts and let you know if there in spec or need repalced.  The continuity funtion simple tells you if the wire or part between the probes is letting current pass through it.  REMEMBER NEVER TEST THE RESISTANCE OR CONTINUITY OF A LIVE CIRCUIT!!  You might just blow a fuse in the meter or blow the whole meter up in your hand!!  Many meters now have temp probes and can help you find problems with dryer air flow or heating elements.  There's not enough time or space here to tell you how to test all the parts or diagnose problems in appliances with your meter, but I would suggest investing in 2 books to help you out.

If you're done painting it, your only option is to repaint with either a glaze or with a new paint.

Be very leery of using anything that could harm your pipes. Because of the age and your statement about drainage issues I would suggest calling out a plumber with camera equipment to asses the whole line to make sure you don't have breakage or root intrusion into the pipe. A little buildup shouldn't be causing a problem with drainage. Expect to pay as much as $300.00 for a reputable firm to camera your drain line. It sounds like a lot but using a power auger snake @ $50.00 to $100.00 a day could cause damage in the thousands of dollars if the pipe is weak. Also if major problems are found the copy of the video can be used to get reimbursed from your insurance company.

Try closing the drivers door and use the key to lock and then unlock the door see if the noise and flashing stop..

Sadly, you need to go to the dealer to get more keys. One, becuase only Honda keys can be programed to your immobilizer system.

Some people would suggest using that "plastic wood" wood putty to build it up but that stuff looks unnatural and you won't like the outcome. Here's an idea. Take off the door and use a plane or sander to make it square and even all the way around. Then re-hang it and you should have an even gap all the way around. You can then take a thin piece of wood (same type of wood, of course) in the right thickness to fill in the gaps. Cut it to the right length, glue it in place, secure it with a few tiny finish nails, sand it so it's flush with the rest of the door, then paint or stain to your heart's content. This is the short version of the process, but I think you get the idea. Don't use that wood putty/plastic wood stuff, it's messy and looks bad. Good Luck. <SEP> How do I fix my internal doors?

You are probably going to have to wait for the wood to dry out.  But to expedite the process get one of those containers by DampRid that has the granules in it to absorb moisture.  Place it in the room along with some oscillating fans.  The DampRid will absorb the moisture out of the air coming from the wood.  Don't put the granules on the wood, just leave it open near to where the spill occurred.Then, once you are certain you have thoroughly dried out the wood, try to use Howards Restore-a-finish in a color similar to your floor.  Because of the variation in parquet flooring, you may need to purchase two different colors.  Fornby's also has a kit you can use, if you cannot find Howards.

Here is a script-based solution which allows one to insert a table with the contents from a given range within a given spreadsheet. I did not try to find a way to sync data real-time, as it didn't seem practical given potentially large volume of data that would have to be transferred with every edit to the spreadsheet. Instead, the script adds a custom menu item "update data" to the document.  The script should be bound to the document (i.e., created using Tools > Script Editor in the document menu). The spreadsheet URL, as well as the sheet and range to use, are specified within the script. To embed all the data on the sheet, replace .getRange(rangeName) with .getDataRange() .  When the function updateData is first executed, it appends the table at the end of document. At subsequent runs, it updates the table in place (i.e., if  more text is added after the table, the order will be preserved).  Note that cutting-pasting the table would break the updating process (the script would add a new table at the end) since the pasted copy is a new object. Instead, cut-paste the text around the table.  function onOpen() {   DocumentApp.getUi()              .createMenu('Custom')              .addItem('Update Data', 'updateData')              .addToUi(); }  function updateData() {   var ssUrl = ' spreadsheet url here ';   var sheetName = 'Sheet2';   // name of sheet to use   var rangeName = 'A1:C3';    // range of values to include     var values = SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl(ssUrl)                              .getSheetByName(sheetName)                              .getRange(rangeName)                              .getValues();   var doc = DocumentApp.getActiveDocument();   var body = doc.getBody();   var ranges = doc.getNamedRanges('embeddedSheet-range');   if (ranges.length == 0) {     var table = body.appendTable(values);   }   else {     tableRange = ranges[0];     table = tableRange.getRange().getRangeElements()[0].getElement();     var ind = body.getChildIndex(table);     tableRange.remove();     body.removeChild(table);     table = body.insertTable(ind, values);   }   var rangeBuilder = doc.newRange();   rangeBuilder.addElement(table);   doc.addNamedRange('embeddedSheet-range', rangeBuilder.build()); }  Technical notes   It's also possible to sync the data every hour, in addition to manually. Just add a time-based trigger from Script Editor's Resources menu, so that it runs the function updateData.  One can also adapt this script to be bound to the source spreadsheet instead. This would require changes in how the document is opened (e.g., by URL), but otherwise the logic is the same.  The cumbersome part of the script is getting the handle of the existing table in the document. This requires placing it within a Named Range. Also, it is much more expedient to completely replace the table element than to mess with the entries of an existing table. Since a Named Range is immutable, it is also removed with the table it contains, and then created again, along with the new table. <SEP> Embed Google Spreadsheet in Google Document <EOS>

Don't know the year and make of your car, but there are usually some service recommendations in your owners manual.  Always start there and see what things haven't been tended to in a while.Could be filters, tire pressure, spark plugs, correct warm-up times, etc.  Put some things on your calender when to do next.Next, take extra weight out of the car; some people drive around with at least an extra hundred pounds in the car.Trying for the "smooth driver award" is the best way to describe good gas mileage driving, no rapid starts, anticipating stoplights, etc.Leaving just a few minutes early for each trip gives you the option of not speeding, and the added benefit of being a safer driver.  Going faster  really burns lots of gas.Lastly, if you have a fuel injected car, you can turn off your engine for stops of over one minute.These steps can easily take in-town mileage from 15mpg to 20mpg, decreasing gas consumption and gas bills by 25%. <SEP> How do I improve my Gas mileage? <EOS>

A maintenence lite is different than a check engine light. The maintanence lite is usually just an indicator telling you that the preset mileage that you are nearing or have reached is due. generally it means that you are do for your oil and filter to be changed. But just changing your oil does not put out the light. You should have a button on your dash for the tripmeter. With the engine off, push the button in, then turn the key to on power with the button still being held in. You should see the mainteneance lite flash or blink. Let go of the button after a few flashes and start the engine. The lite should now be off and reset until the next time that you are do for the oil change.

Proper tire inflation.Empty out excess junk from your car.Proper maintenance, oil change, air filters, spark plugs.Driving habits -- Drive smoothly, no full throttle stops.  Look ahead and anticipate what traffic and traffic lights are going to do.  No need to continue acceleration of the light ahead is red, coast to the light.Lower your driving speeds.  If I recall, wind resistance increases as a square related to your speed.  So if you double your speed, you will quadruple the wind resistance.Remove your roof rack or other such things from the top of your vehicle.Next time you need new tires, see if you can "downsize" to a more narrow tire.  Of course, keep in mind the tire must fit and carry at least as much load as the previous size.But the biggies are in HOW you drive.Also, not related to fuel economy, but fuel consumption, see about combining trips, or planning the most efficient route. <SEP> how to get bettr gas milage? i have a pt cruiser and it does not get very good gas milage like it should.how can i improve it? <EOS>

Go under your car and unscrew the oil plug.  It's going to be messy.  Oil will begin pouring out the hole into your oil catcher.  Wait until all the oil is poured out.  (now is also a good time to change your oil filter - but that's another question).  Rethread the oil plug - do NOT overtighten.  According to your manufacturer's manual, put the proper oil back in (i.e., 10-40, 10-30, etc).  You pour it back in where you unscrewed the cap at the beginning.  Put in the amount of quarts your manual states.  Check your oil dipstick to ensure you've put in the proper amount (not too little, not too much).  Good luck!  You can do it and save yourself a lot of money. <SEP> how do you drain oil from your car yourself? <EOS>

Only way to have dirt and crud on the inside of the headlight is if it is cracked and broken and dirt is getting inside.  Usually the plastic gets a "milky" or smokey tint to it that can most times be restored or removed by putting a good coating of rainx on the headlight outside and rubbing well.  It is amazing how well this works on some that are almost no longer transparent.  Try it if you get a chance. <SEP> How do I clean the inside of my Ford Focus headlights?

I am actually almost certain it has to do with people who view your page because I was thinking about this and conducted a little experiment (it's kinda confusing but bear with me).  I started off by typing every letter of the alphabet and seeing who came up on the search. So for example, I typed "A" and saw who came up. I noticed that the list of people were not necessarily in alphabetical order, but the people at the top were certainly my closest friends whose pages I visit all the time.  Then I thought maybe Facebook sets the search bar up conveniently for you to find the people you visit the most. But then I saw something strange, the girl that I just added was actually the second person in the "L" list, the first being my best friend, so that seemed odd to me.  So then I started thinking that it might actually have to do with the people who visit your page. To test the theory, I went to my "C" list, where the top two people were actually pretty much equal in terms of how many times I've visited their page and I assume they've visited mine. I went to the second person in the "C" list and clicked on their page a lot, refreshed it a few good times. Then I went back and searched "C" and sure enough, it was now the second friend whose page I had been refreshing who showed up first . I knew that this second friend was camping and had no Facebook/no way of looking at my page.  Now here's the real kicker: I told my other friend in the "C" list, the one who used to be first when I searched "C" to go on my page a couple of times. She did. I then took a couple of minutes and searched "C" again, and guess who came up first?  That's right, the girl who had just searched my page, despite the fact that I had been looking up the other girl's page recently.  Does this really prove that the Facebook search bar operates on people who have viewed your profile? Maybe, but it could also prove that I have WAY too much time on my hands. <SEP> How does Facebook guess results when you search for someone? <EOS>

You must run a refrigerator closed for a considerable period of time (perhaps overnight) to determine if it is cooling properly.  It would help if you placed thermometers in the cooler and freezer so that you have true values.  You should check that the regulator (dial?) is set for very cold, that the door seals are in good shape and that the heat exchanger (coil on the back or underneath) is clean of dirt and dust.  Also, defrost the freezer if there is an ice buildup.  Give the refrigerator the best chance to win before giving up.  Refrigerators work best if they have lots of item in the freezer and cooler (even milk cartons of water for a test).  If the unit is still under warranty, call for service.  You may have a bad compressor if there is no cooling effect or a bad thermostat to regulate temperature.  The unit should cycle on and off if it is cooling properly.  The age of the machine should help dictate whether you have it repaired (off warranty) or replace it.  Good luck. <SEP> how do I fix my refridgerator?

Since nobody wants to tell you what to do...I will. Get an oil drain pan. Get 4to 5 quarts of oil and the recommended oil filter. Put the drain pan under the car directly under the oil pan drain plug. Use a six point socket or wrench, And an oil filter wrench that fits your cars oil filter. The six point ones help keep you from stripping the bolt head. If it seems tight bump the wrench in the direction you need to go.with your hand. A bump breaks free bolts that you can't get loose a lot easier. Try not to drop the drain bolt in the drain pan unless you get one that has a catch screen designed to keep things from falling into the oil drain pan. Once the oil has drained. Reinstall the drain plug. Make sure if it has a gasket on it that the gasket is there when you reinstall it... It can be over looked if the gasket fell off the plug..Next. Remove oil filter using the oil filter wrench. Unscrew it and let it drain in the pan. Then physically look at the filter and make sure the rubber gasket is still on the old filter. It is possible for the filter to come off,and the o ring gasket to stay stuck on the engine... This is a big no no. Because if you screw the new filter on with the old gasket in place it's not gonna seal and make a huge mess when you start your car. Now that you know that you don't have the old gasket still on, take the new filter and put a light film of oil on the gasket of the new filter.... You can use new or old oil to put on the gasket..It doesn't matter. Screw new filter on as tight as you can by hand. Then take your filter wrench" and I only say this because your a femal and may not have the hand strenth to get it tight enough with out the tool. And tighten it another1/4 to 1/2 turn. Then just fill it up with oil. Put in 3 quarts and check the dipstick. Then just keep adding oil till the dipstick finally is on the full mark. Then start your vehicle. look under it and see if you have any leaks.... Turn the car off and wait 1 to 2 mins and check the level again. Then just fill as needed till oil on the dipstick where it should be and your done.

Now, the problem is that when I use the control by the wall, I can close it but when I use the remote control, I had to press it so many times before the door closes, if at all. 95% of the time, the door just starts to close and then springs back up, even if there is no object obstructing the laser beam at the bottom.

You can unplug the connector to disable the lock-up.  It is easy to get to.  Replacing the solenoid is easy also.

While the car is idling, pull off the hose to the egr valve and hook up a vaccuum pump to the egr valve. When you pump it up the car should stall if the egr valve is fully functioning. If the idle doesn't change either the egr valve is stuck closed or the egr passages are so clogged with carbon no air can get through. If you have a scan tool and can get a DPFE voltage reading you should hook up the vaccuum pump to the egr valve and pump it while watching the DPFE voltage reading.

There are four common things that will cause your machine to not spin.1) A bad lid switch2) A bad motor coupling3) A bad timer4) A worn spin clutchWith a bad lid switch the machine just stops when it it supposed to spin and drain.

Ok Tessiecom,  If the door you have is not a "pre-hung" door then you're in for a challenge.  Although a pre-hung door can be installed much easier than a "slab door", it can be done.  The first website below will show you how to install a door that is pre-hung.  and the second will give you some ideas on what is involved in prepping the slab door before hanging it.  I hope this helps, and I will add more as I find it.The last link is a Lowe's link, it's pretty detailed.  Another thought I had is that a lauan door is generally hollow, which doesn't leave much wood around the outside edge of the door.  That translates into "not much room for error"  especially where the mortising for hinges and beveling doors edge is concerned.  So one helpful hint- Measure Twice and Cut Once.  Good luck. <SEP> how do i install a lauan door? <EOS>

First off, if you drop the thermostat into boiling water that is at least 190 degrees, you should see the center disc move away from the outer disc.On a more realistic note, I doubt you have a bad thermostat.  What was your reason for replacement in the first place?  If the car wasn't overheating originally, more than likely you have an air pocket in the cooling system.  Many cars come with a bleeder somewhere in the cooling system that allows air to escape.  If you do not bleed the air out, you have a cavity with no coolant.  This expands at a different rate than the coolant and can cause some serious issues with the vehicle.  Please respond with more information about why you replaced the thermostat and what kind of car you have. <SEP> How do I check a car thermostat with boiling water? My car is overheating.  I put in a new thermostat, test drove it - it overheated and the coolant backed up big time into the overflow tank.

The copper button moved out some, but how do I tell if it "opened?"  Should I be able to see light through it at some points? <EOS>
Go to Lowes or Home Depot, or I suppose any hardware store, and but a squeeze bottle of concrete repair.All you need do, provided the crack is small, is squeeze the mixture in the crack, and smooth it out. Make sure, it's the same color, usually a grey color, for a better match. If the crack is bigger, you may need the box, of concrete powder, where you have to add water, to make up a paste.

I created a command-line tool to handle this.  After following the setup instructions on the GitHub project, you can run the tool with a specified path prefix and the email address of the new owner:  python transfer.py PATH-PREFIX NEW-OWNER-EMAIL  After getting authorization from OAuth, it will recursively walk the Google Drive account it got authorization to, match against the path prefix (ignoring non-matches), and then transfer ownership to the new email. If the new email address indicates a user who isn't even shared on the item yet, it will handle that as well. The current owner will not lose access, but the new or old owner can revoke it.  I should note that it's not always possible to transfer ownership of an item in Drive. For example, it's not possible to move ownership for an item from G Suite (Google Apps for Work) account to a normal GMail account. It can be shared (which the script will do), but ownership transfer will fail. <SEP> How can I recursively set ownership of Google Drive files and folders? <EOS>

I have the same phone, and last february I walked into a Battery Plus store (to help my friend find a phone) and the guy working there said that my phone (the z520a) is notorious for having battery problems.

My cell phone apparently ran out of battery juice about 5 weeks ago and tried to recharge it, and when I plugged it ti the charger nothing happened.

Then I called Cingular to see what's going on, they were not able to help, and then I went to a local Cingular store and they said none of the C stores have technicians to repair phones. So now I have cell that is partially apart (because I unscrewed all the screwes that keep together and tried to put only 2 screws back (half way). Can anybody help me with ideas, suggestions, proven methods of fixing, or at least direct me to some local places(about 10-15 miles around 98043-which is just 10 miles north from Seattle), busineses that can fix it for sure and not costing a lot of money?Thanks, Paul. <EOS>
In order to estimate how many shingles you'll need, first you need to estimate  the total square footage of your roof's surface. Just measure the length and width of each plane on the roof, including dormers. Then, multiply length x width to get the square footage of each plane. Simply add the square footage of each of the planes together to derive the total square footage of your roof.EXAMPLE:Plane 1: 120' x 100' = 12,000 sq. ft.Plane 2: 120' x 100' = 12,000 sq. ft.Plane 1 + Plane 2 = 24,000 sq. ft. for the total square footage of the roof.Roof surfaces are measured in "squares." A "square" is an area of roof which measures 100 square feet. To determine the number of squares on the gable roof above, for example, simply divide its total of 24,000 square feet by 100. Which means you will need 240 "squares" of shingles to cover it. The most common type of shingle, called a three-tab or strip shingle, is generally packaged three bundles per square.If this is a new roof, you will also need 240 squares of underlayment (no underlayment is needed if you are applying shingles directly over an existing asphalt roof). Underlayment usually comes in rolls of four squares each, so covering 240 squares would require 60 rolls of underlayment.Good luck! <SEP> how do i measure my roof for shingles? <EOS>

If you threw a rod your car may still run. I am a mechanic and I have recent replaced 2 motors that threw rods and they both ran. One was in a ford and it had a big hole in the side of the block.

If you threw a rod and the car runs it will shake really bad and probably knock very loud.

If you already have a phone jack in the back of your computer, then the above user is correct.  If you do not, there may be several approaches to solving your problem.First you need a modem.  If you want to use the computer to answer the phone, save and play voice mail, etc. then all you need is a data/fax/voice modem.  They are installed as a PCI card in an available slot in your computer, and provide a phone jack for the physical connection.  They usually include software for sending and receiving faxes, voicemail, and receiving and making voice calls.  You will need a microphone and speakers, or headset (easier to use)Here is an example of a PCI fax/data/voice modem: http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=50179302&pfp=BROWSEIf you want to connect your phone line to your computer for internet access, a PCI fax/data/voice modem will work, but is very slow.  You can also connect to the internet via your phone using a DSL modem.  DSL uses wires in your phone line but does not prevent you from making or receiving calls on your house line.  DSL is also much faster than "dial-up" internet access using the PCI fax/data/voice modem.For connecting a DSL modem, you will need a 10/100 Ethernet PCI card instead of the PCI fax/data/voice modem.Well, I hope this helps.

The broken bead will leak like others have said but should only cause a pull if it is low on air. Now another pull is alignment related. The last type of pull is from the physical make-up of the tire. The easiest way to eliminate if it is a tire pull is to have the car taken to a shop and have the front tires only rotated side to side. If the pull follows the tire from the right front you know that the problem is not an alignment issue but a tire issue.

I had a cigarette burn in my old apartment carpet because I allowed a guest to smoke. So this is what I did to get my deposit back.

Where the cigarette burn was I carefully cut the burnt part off the carpet fibers without leaving a bald spot. Next I used fabric glue (you can buy this at a craft shop, the kind you can make invisible hems with or just cloth craft glue) I put a couple of drops in the area I just took the burnt part up.

The covers are removable but you will need a thin-bladed flat screwdriver.  At the side of the cover where you press to turn them on, you have to insert the edge of the screwdriver. Then, you carefully pry that side of the cover down.  There is a tab inside that must be pryed away from the base.  The cover will stay hinged and will hang by one side to allow access to the bulb.

Sounds like you have a loose neutral.  Sometimes under a load a poor connection will finally give way.  If I had to guess I would say the outlets were "back stabbed"; that is, the electrician used the connections on the back of the outlet.  If they are daisy chained, then when one connection goes bad it impacts every other outlet down the line.  The only way to verify it is to pull the outlets out and check the connection.  If you discover that is the problem, remake the connections on the screw terminal.  Turn the power off and don't do it if you feel unprepared for the job.  Doing it wrong could cause a fire or electrocution. <SEP> how to troubleshoot 2 wall outlets that suddenly quit working after turning on a lamp plugged in.? happened when turned on lamp plugged in to 1 of the outlets, no breakers tripped. when test outlet with a circuit tester get nothing when probes in both slots (where you plug things in) but it does light up when the probe is in 1 slot & other probe to ground. <EOS>

Use a straight blade to apply drywall compound to each side of the corner.  Crease the tape and press lightly into the corner.  Smooth it out with the corner trowel.  Most inexperienced drywallers apply too much compound when laying in the tape and also try to acheive a finished look with just one application.  When done properly, the tape will be embedded in the compound but not covered with compound.  When the compound is dry, apply a second coat the same way but skip the application of the tape.  Practice in a closet where mistakes won't be noticeable.Good luck with your project. <SEP> how do I apply drywall plaster to corners?

Well those are some interesting answers.But anyways you need to have the unit checked by a tech-All (MOst) units will drip water. its just how the system runs. and there could be a few things wrong with yours. the defrost sensor could be bad. this would cause the unit to freeze up and not work correct. even in the winter if you have the heat on the unit will run the ac side and when it frost up it will defrost itself. and if the freon is low it could cause this.Im really shocked no one said the sensor though. I have fixed about 120units this winter and 50% plus have been the sensor and 40% freon 10% other small stuff (filter/breaker/electric panel/motor) At any rate you need to have someone come out and service the Unit. You cant do this yourself sorry to say.

No disrespect, but next time give more info: year your house was built, your landscape style that you mentioned but we have no idea what style it is.My house was built in 1906 and I chose a picket fence of my own unique design around the front yard; have 6' privacy fence of cedar around backyard ~ and nine different style gates that I have fun with, decorating and painting.Split-rail fences look especially good with ranch style houses and 1950-1960s houses.  Then again, I like them just about anywhere.  Picket fences date back to Victorian era, but widely used on just about any style house.  There's a saying:  If you want the fence to show, paint it white; If you want the garden to show, don't paint the fence.

Blood stains can be one of the most difficult spots to remove from any kind of fabric. If you have a blood stain on your mattress, treat it with some hydrogen peroxide. Pat the stain with a towel (one that you don’t mind bleaching, preferably white), working from the outer circle of the stain in. You will notice the spot start to bubble as the hydrogen peroxide works to remove the stain. Keep applying and blotting the spot until the blood is removed. Warning: Hydrogen peroxide can bleach fabric. Using it on your mattress may bleach it. Make sure you spot-check your mattress before applying hydrogen peroxide.Also - if there is any way to set it in the sun, outside, for a few hours after you've cleaned it, the sun is a great bleaching tool.  (Plus, it helps refresh the mattress, and rid it of any unpleasant odors.) <SEP> How do you get a large blood stain out of a matress? <EOS>

Purchase a short wire fish from Lowes or Home Depot (~$20).  Greenlee is a good brand.  Get a short one, 25' or smaller, for this application.  Drill small hole ( 1/2" diameter ) at top, where your speaker will go.  Do in a spot where there are no studs behind the hole.  Figure this out with a stud finder (~$10) or just knock on the drywall lightly and listen to the pitch difference as you move horizontally along the wall.  You want the hollow sounding knock to avoid contention with a stud.  DIRECTLY below this hole, drill another that will be slightly larger... maybe 3/4".   For bonus points, you might consider pulling back the baseboard molding so you can make your hole behind it (and thereby conceal the hold when replacing the molding).Roll out enough of the wire fish to span the distance between the holes (plus about a foot) and feed it into the upper one.  Curl the end of a thin metal coat hanger to fit into the lower hole and use it to grab the end of the wire fish.  Pull it out into the room.Tape your spreaker wire on good and pull through from above.  If you live in an older house with plaster walls, this is going to be more of a mess.  I wouldn't advise doing it.Doing this procedure on an exterior wall will work okay, but will require pushing the wire fish a little harder so it finds its way through insulation.  Your hole on the bottom may need to be a little bigger in order to successfully grab the wire fish.Good luck. <SEP> How do I snake wire through an existing wall? <EOS>

if you have lingering smell of sewage in your home - the first thing to do is to make sure that none of your plumbing traps have evaporated.  Traps are designed to always have a level of water in them in order to prevent sewer gases from travelling up into the home.Go to each shower, tub & sink and run the water for a few seconds.  Additionally, if you have a toilet which has no water in it, yet is still hooked up to the plumbing, pour water into the toilet bowl until there is water sitting in the toilet bowl.  This will ensure that the trap will be filled.If a fixture (sink, tub, shower, toilet) goes unused for a certain amount of time, the water in the trap will eventually evaporate thus making for a clear path for the sewer gases to make their way into the bathroom, kitchen, etc.  If you still have the smell of sewer gases after doing the above, have a plumber check your sewer system outside, if you have a private system (non-public).  You also might have a filled septic tank which needs emptied.  Logically, this will eventually occur for everyone who has a septic tank since all collection tanks eventually need emptied.  If all your in-house plumbing is working correctly and your septic tank is not full and backed-up, then you should not be encountering sewer gases.  Also check your garbage disposal:  certain rotting foods in the bottom of sink drains tend to smell like a sewer.  Again, do a good cleaning and regular cleaning of all your drains to avoid this.  Also, unless you have a working garbage disposal, do not let solid food make it's way down your drain.  Food items can easily get stuck and thus start the rotting process while it's still within smelling range. <SEP> How can i get rid of the smell of sewage?

Setting your thermostat at 74 is part of your problem, in warmer months it should be set around 65-68.But about your main problem...The air gap between the floor and insulation is normal.

From what I read as long as you're projects are under $30,000 in value a contractors license is not required.  If in excess of $30,000 and under $300,000 then you need the limited license and these are the requirements.1.) Be entitled to be admitted to sit in on the license exam2.) Your assets have to exceed your debt by $17,0003.) Score a 70% or above on the exam4.) If you or any other owner, priciple, or qualifier is in bankruptcy you'll have to submit an audited financialstatement with classified balance sheet.The exam fee for this level was like $100 and the annual license fee was $75.If you planned on working on projects costing more than $300,000 then there's more stringent standards and you also will be dealing with bonding issues. <SEP> how do i get a contactors lisence for north caralina? roofing and home improvments. <EOS>
Replacing the starter is rather easy. First make sure you disconnect the battery. If you don't sparks may fly.

The most common reason to replace tires is insufficient tread depth. The grooves in the tire channel water away to prevent hydroplaning, which results in a loss of traction. When a tire has less than 3/32" tread depth, it's ability to channel the water is diminished and it's time to replace it. A rule of thumb is to stick a penny in the tread with the top of Lincoln's head parallel to the surface of the tire. If any part of his head is exposed, the tire should be replaced. Most tires also have tread wear indicators that show as bars across the tire when there's insuffucuent tread.Anytime a tire has small cracks in the sidewall, or is mis-shapen in any way, it should be replaced. <SEP> how to know when to change tires? <EOS>

I have to agree with the other posters.  If you want an accurate assessment you will need to call an appraiser.  A Realtor can give you an idea of what similar homes in your area have recently sold for or are currently listed at.  The websites out there are just crap.  They use loan info to give you a value.  My house was bought with cash,  one website (zillow) values it with the foreclosure amount of the previous owner from 2 years ago (nothing to do with current market conditions) and the same website shows our neighbors house (paid 1/2 cash and financed 1/2) for the amount financed as the value of the home.  Another website shows my house being 30 years older than it actually is, bringing the value down.  None of the websites have the square footage correct.

Your car can pull left or right for a number of reasons, one of which is poor alignment. Unless you hit something or your car has a buttload of miles on it or you played Ricky Racer and tampered with the springs, chances are your alignment is fine. Worn or out-of-balance tires often play havoc with your steering. They will make it do all kinds of funny things, like pull to one side, or shake the steering wheel, or make your car very hard to steer, especially at low speed. The two expendable things in the suspension system of your car are tires and shocks (or struts). More driving, more wear. So get them checked first if you are having handling or tire wear issues. Poor alignment will make your tires wear unevenly, as will worn shocks or struts. If you wreck your car or hit the curb hard enough, your alignment can get messed up. Over time, rubber components in the suspension go bad, causing misalignment. I wouldn't get it checked more than once every couple of years. In fact, I never have had it checked on any of my cars. Never had problems, either. <SEP> How do you know if your alignment is messed up? How often do you need to get that looked at? <EOS>

First we need to find out if your supply piping is copper or iron. If it is iron the pipes are most likely rusty & corroded inside causing restriction of flow. You can also try changing the aerator (that little screen at the end of the spout) if flow is also slow on the cold water side. Most likely it is the supply pipe as hot water will speed up the corrosion which is why you dont see any slowness on the cold side. If iron pipe the only solution would be to repipe the entire house.

Im A plumber so here is you answer.Its hard to answer You didnt say where it was leaking.A quick run down You have a fill valve/  Douglas Valve/Flapper/Tank to bowl gasket with bolts and a wax ring with or without horn.1st dry off the WC (water closet=Toilet) and try to find out where the water is from2nd if its on the floor then its is the wax ring. Remove the supply line and bolts and replace the wax ring. if its where the bowl and tank meet then its the tank to bowl gasket set (3.99 Home depot) Remove bolts and gasket and replace. TIP when putting the new bolts on use plumbers dope on rubber washers to make a good seal also put Dope on gasket and tank and bowl for good seal. If its from there area where the supply line is going in thats the fill valve. Most WC have a valve with a rod and long ball on the end. DO not replace it with the same one Go to Home depot and Get A fluid master 400a And replace. And supply line check connections if bad then replace.3 other things could be a hair line crack in tank or bowl.also the flapper. inside the WC best way to check use some food coloring from the kitchen put 5 or so drops in the tank stir up a bit in 20 min or so if you used red and the water in the bowl is red then flapper is bad but this could also mean The seal or unit its on is bad. Replace. (this is also a good thing to do at 1st use the color red or blue and where you see it is where the problem is.but last WC= will sweet the temp of the water and the temp outside if there is a certain change it will sweet. You can fix it will a liner in the tank. Home depot again.But with all this info you might have a Kohler 1 PC wc and some of this does not even apply I wish you could have gave some more info on the unit.

A 85 olds getting 25mpg sounds pretty decent already but if you really want to add a couple more miles to that gallon I suggest a major tune up if not already done after that routine maintenance would help dramatically, most automotive service shops offer a type of fuel system cleaning to my knowledge the 3M system is the best to clean the tank,fuel lines,injectors/carburetor this service usually includes both fuel filters on your car make shure to ask .  look in to getting a K&N filter the 49$ to me is worth the 100,000 miles you get out of it better air flow means better combustion =  increased fuel economy also have your exhaust system checked leaks cracks cat. converter  ect . one more note get a four wheel alignment and keep your tires inflated to factory specs. to have all these services preformed on your car would cost a lot less than that down payment for a new car . <SEP> How can I increase fuel mileage?

Front Wheel Bearing and Hub ReplacementTools RequiredJ 42129 Wheel Hub Remover (this is a fairly generic tool you can rent from some parts stores - you may or may not need this tool - you won't know for sure until you remove the hub nut as outlined below)Removal ProcedureRaise and support the vehicle.Remove the tire and wheel.Disconnect the wheel speed sensor electrical connector (2), if equipped.  Remove the wheel speed sensor electrical connector from the bracket, if equipped. Remove the front wheel drive shaft nut. Insert a drift or flat-bladed tool into the caliper and rotor to prevent from turning. Remove the brake rotor. (Removing the dront driveshaft nut is going to be the hardest part of the repair.  It is a large nut - 36mm if I remember correctly - and torqued to over 140 ft lbs) Use 3 wheel nuts in order to attach the J 42129 to the wheel bearing/hub.Use the J 42129 in order to push the wheel drive shaft out of the wheel bearing/hub. (often times the drive shaft will push out of the hub with only hand pressure - the older and more rust on it, the more likely you are to need the tool to overcome the rust) Remove and DISCARD the wheel bearing/hub bolts. Remove the J 42129 from the hub. Important: Ensure that the wheel drive shaft outer seal/boot is not damaged. Remove the wheel bearing/hub and splash shield-noting the position of the shield for re-installation. Installation ProcedureInstall the wheel bearing/hub with the splash shield as noted during removal.Caution: These fasteners MUST be replaced with new fasteners anytime they become loose or are removed. Failure to replace these fasteners after they become loose or are removed may cause loss of vehicle control and personal injury.Install NEW wheel bearing/hub bolts. Tighten Tighten the NEW wheel bearing/hub bolts to 130 N·m (96 lb ft).Install the brake rotor and caliper.Install the front wheel drive shaft nut. Insert a drift on a flat-bladed tool into caliper and rotor to prevent the rotor from turning. Tighten Tighten the front wheel drive shaft nut to 160 N·m (118 lb ft).Important: Ensure that the connector clip engages the bracket properly. Install the wheel speed sensor electrical connector to the bracket, if equipped.  Connect the wheel speed sensor electrical connector (2), if equipped. Install the tire and Lower the vehicle.

I highly recommend doing a brake job when replacing the rotors... but here's how to replace just the rotors:Jack up the car. Take off tire.  The caliper will be mounted with 2 allen cap screws which need to be removed.  Hang the caliper, momentarily, with a wire coat hanger or get a friend to hang onto it.  The brake rotor should pull right off.  (You may need to give it a sharp blow with a hammer.)  Install the new rotor.  Replace the caliper and secure using the allen cap screws.  Reinstall tires.  Repeat for the opposite side.  Try not to move the brake pads when removing the brake calipers.  If you have to pry to get them off take the cover off your brake master cylinder or you might blow it out.  It's easy... you'll be fine. <SEP> how to replace acura cl front brake rotor? <EOS>

you did not state what is wrong with the axle.is the ring & pinion or differential shot?or is there something wrong with the hubs.contrary to what the dude before said, an axle from the 88-2001 GM trucks is going to cost a whole lot more then the previous year 14 bolt rear ends. the rear ends from a 73-87 body style truck are a dime a dozen and should only cost you $100-$200 at a junkyard.the 14 bolt axle had some design changes that started in 1988, and they arent as common as the old version (the old version came in the 3/4 and 1 ton trucks, the 1988 3/4 ton trucks used a semi floating axle as well as the full floating).  also since they arent as plentiful as the old design 14 bolt, they cost more, i would expect to pay in the area of $900+ to from a wrecker.depending on what bearings need to be replace, if its the differential bearings, you can get the entire kit for around $110-$150, and a gear set for $200, and then add $300-$400 for a shop to set them up.  luckily from the 14 bolts design, they are probaly the easiest axle to setup gears on so the shops dont charge as much as they would say a Dana series axle.they also charge less if you just bring them the housing out of the truck instead of the entire truck, its easier to replace everything while it is sitting on a bench instead of under the truck. <SEP> How to repair and replace a rearend of 97 Chev.

You can use the chisel and hammer method, or even a rotary hammer to do it but if you do this you risk damaging the concrete blocks.  My advice would be to rent a Concrete Saw (the back end looks like a chainsaw and it will have a 10-14" diamond blade on the front end).  Cut the grout line down the middle and try to avoid angling the blade.  To help you cut a straight line you can get a 4 1/2" grinder and a diamond blade for it (the diamond blades can be expensive i'll warn you) and use it to score the grout) if worse comes to worse you can get a 7" diamond blade and throw it on a skilsaw and use it set to a very, very shallow depth to cut your score line.This is a physically harder way of doing it but you'll have a much lower risk of busting blocks which if you used a rotary drill and chisel you almost certainly would.  I also doubt it takes much to cut through the grout. <SEP> How do I take appert cement blocks that have been cemented together? <EOS>

lol, I had a light come on my dash that said "service engine" and I thought it was the check engine light.  I just had to turn the car off, press and hold the trip meter button and start it with it held and wait 10 more seconds and the light went out.If it's really the check-engine light, you may have a problem.  These problems range from having the gas cap on loose to a major computer-engine interface problem.I have a scanner to see and diagnose those problems but you may have to go to a dealer to get yours.  First url below is a link to the trouble codes.  To see the codes do the following:"When the Check Engine warning light has been reported on, turn the ignition on, move the front passenger seat to the rear position and observe the LED on the front of the ECU. The LED indicates a system failure code by blinking frequency. The ECU LED can indicate any number of simultaneous component problems by blinking separate codes, one after another.If output indicates CODE 4, 11, 15, 16 or exceeds 17, count the number of blinks again. If the indicator is in fact, blinking these codes, substitute a known-good ECU and recheck If the indication goes away, replace the original ECU."I'm guessing that you don't have a "known good ECU" anywhere so that means go to the dealer or your local trusted genius friend auto mechanic.Hopefully you find what's wrong by reading the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) blinks and flashes and this information will steer you in the right direction. <SEP> how to reset the check engen light on a 1994 honda civic ex? <EOS>

The ECU is located on the front floor, about under the passenger's toes. Pull the carpet down; a large protective cover will be seen over the ECU. On the upper edge of the cover is a window or opening, allowing the Light Emitting Diode (LED) to be viewed. Turn the ignition ON, but do not start the engine. The LED should begin to flash. NOTE: In the event that a code is encountered which is not on the chart, re-count the number of flashes. If the code is truly wrong, it will be necessary to swap the ECU for a known-good unit and recheck. Since this can be expensive, you may wish to bring the car to a reputable repair facility if no other cause of the failure can be found. This may save you the expense of purchasing an unnecessary part. Once the codes are read, refer to the appropriate troubleshooting chart for testing procedures. Note that some tests will require the Honda test harness. (Use harness No. 07HAZ-PJ7010A and 07HAZ–PH7000A for 1988–89 and 07LAJ–PT30100 for 1990). This is a device which allows safe testing of the electrical circuits without backprobing connectors. It installs between the ECU and the wiring harnesses.

Dude -- I hate to be rude, but let's start with the basics. First, clean your house. I don't mean straighten out the junk, I mean CLEAN. Throw stuff away. Use Pinesol (it comes in scents, now, not just that pine tar smell) or some other type of cleaning agent that does not require rinsing (the underlying pine scent helps repel all types of critters). Clean out under all your sinks (bath and kitchen) and throw away anything that is not absolutely required. Close up all holes in all walls -- such as where pipes come in under sinks and behind gas ranges (rats and mice love crawling along hidden pipes -- they are a veritable rodent raceways).  Check also behind your 'fridge, particularly if you have an icemaker (the water source has to come from some where). Ensure your dryer vent has some way of closing when not in use (there a lot of options available at every hardware store). Find, dry and repair the source of all water leaks -- those buggers really need and seek out water (there might be a double whammy if there is a leaky pipe hidden in a wall or ceiling -- that just needs fixing).  That includes emptying the drip tray under your fridge.  Those buggers can live under that fridge in the warmth drinking from that drip tray. Repair all openings in the siding of your house -- those buggers are getting in somewhere.  Repair or replace all screen doors (I had a 3lb rat get into my house because I left the door wide open on a beautiful spring day. The rat died...so did my dog.) Put your food away. No opened food containers on the counter, stove or fridge. Make sure all of the "water traps" are filled in all of your unused bathrooms and toilets (those are the things that keep the sewer gases out of your house, if they dry out they provide an open source for rodents and insects to come in from the sewer (yuck).Now, once you've closed all means for the buggers to get in (and out) it's time to kill those that you have. If you don't mind the smell of putrifying rodent bodies, go ahead and lay out some DCon -- BUT NOT IF YOU HAVE KIDS OR PETS.  I prefer the old fashioned "clap-traps." They may be a bit primative, but you don't have rodent carcasses fermenting in places you can't see.  I usually bait the traps with peanut butter and throw the whole thing away once I capture a bugger. If you reuse the traps, you may have boil them to get the smell of the dead one off the trap otherwise you may not catch another one.  Put the traps in corners that are out of the way but are visible enough to see if they caught anything. Keep the bait facing away from the corner. If rats are infesting your house, you may have to fill all of the holes with a combination of broken glass (use broken beer bottles) and steel wool. The rats will chew thru vertually any other material, so the glass/steel wool will act as a rodent barrier underneath the cosmetic caulk or foam filling the hole. You'll get rid of them all if you are merciless and relentless. As nasty as it is, you'll just have go on a full scale attack. Good luck. <SEP> How do I get rid of rodents in my house without having to actually touch one or even see one? <EOS>
Remove the drive shaft.  Support the engine because it will want to drop down when the cross member/rear engine mount is removed.  Remove the rear engine mount and transmission.  Remove the starter.  Remove the bell housing.  Remove the inspection plate.  Now you should be able to see the torque converter as well as the flex-plate and starter ring.  The torque converter is bolted to the flex-plate.  If you move to the front of the flex-plate and inspect it you should see some nuts around the outside of the plate.  These nuts hold the torque converter.  As you remove the nuts you will have to lever the flex plate around to bring each successive nut down to the 6 o'clock position for removal.  After all the nuts are removed the converter will fall out.  A piece of rope or a strong wire is a good idea to hold it in place while you remove the nuts.I check my mail at least twice a day.

jack it up ,not much,just enough to get some of the weight off loosen up the lugs on that side,once that is done do the same thing to the other side. now you can raise it (jack it up)as high as you can, remove the rest of the lugs and remove the tires and place your tires on the ground under your brakes (its a safety thing + it gives you something to sit on ) there are 2 bolts (calipers) that have a female slot in the shape of an hexagon. Get your self an Allen wrench and a pry bar and break them loose, once these are out then you can remove your brake assembly and remove your pads note;there are metal clips on the back side of your pads you need these they are important they hold your pads in place. use them unless you have new ones. now you will need an C clamp to squeeze the brake back together now you can put the pads on clip and all and put the brake assembly back together and after having done that now you are ready to do the other side <SEP> how do you install brake pads on a 1992 Olds 98 Regency? <EOS>

first indication is of course water or stains on your ceilings. see if the shingles are starting to curl up or if the surface of your roof appears uneven or bumpy. does the roof appear discolored in certain areas. also check in your gutters, are they full of little stones [a bit bigger then grains of sand]. these are all indications that you need to replace your roof. most shingles last 10-15 years with 20 years being the max. when replacing always strip off old shingles. never allow anyone to put new shingles over old. hope this helps. have a good day <SEP> How can I tell when my roof needs replacing? <EOS>
I really don't think you can bleed a clutch plate.  but you can bleed the clutch assembly.  Anyway if you have a hydraulic clutch system. Locate the reservoir and fill it with fluid normally Dot-3 brake FUD.  You must bleed the reservoir first, to bleed it you must open and close the hydraulic line at the cylinder. Then locate the bleed valve on the actuator (master cylinder) unit. You must bleed it also.  Have someone to pump the clutch paddle 15 times and hold it to the floor.  Open the valve quickly and let out the air, close the valve, have them to release the paddle and repeat until the air is gone.

Before you do anything check with your local electrical codes.  You do not want to make your house impossible to sell by any works you do.Different procedures are used for different directions in pulling the new wire.  Because of the wall studs, you cannot pull a wire horizontally without removing the wall covering to locate or drill holes in the studs.If you a pulling a wire up through the space between studs, a fish or snake (stiff wire ribbon on a spool) is just fine as long as you know the location of the feeder hole for the new wire.  If you are trying to wire a new switch from an old near floor level duplex box, you can feed the wire up by dropping a light chain from the switch box hole down to the duplex. <SEP> how do I pull electrical wire through a wall? <EOS>

Like most places in California, the hot topic around the water cooler at our office is the rising cost of gasoline. We have seen a drastic increase in gas prices over the past several months and we haven't even reached the summer yet. There has also been talk of premium unleaded costing three bucks by the time summer exits. Thank god my commuter is a Miata (stop laughing) and it gets a gas-sipping 30 miles a gallon on the highway, unlike my other four vehicles, which are only able to muster 20 or so miles per gallon. Keeping them in top shape is a major priority. As many of you might already know, a well maintained vehicle not only saves you money at the pump but can also increase performance. Everyday commuters can easily perform some of these tips while some require skills and specialized technical equipment. We will rate each task on a one to 10 scale so you can decide for yourself whether you can perform these tasks or if you should have a hired mechanic perform them for you.1 One of the easiest and simplest preventative steps you can take is checking tire pressure. If a vehicle's tire is not inflated to the proper specifications, it can cause additional drag on asphalt, slowing the vehicle down. Not only can the situation waste gas, but it may also lead to hazardous driving conditions. First check the manufacturers pressure rating on the tire's sidewall. It should read something like "maximum tire pressure xx". With that information, inflate the tire pressure of all four tires to two or three psi below the maximum pressure. Never inflate the tire past the maximum pressure! Difficulty: 2.2 If you love your car you must be religious, not it the sense of believing in God, but religious in the sense of changing your oil. Oil and filter changes should occur every 3000 miles or even more frequently depending on driving conditions. Changing your oil can be as easy as going to the nearest Jiffy Lube or similar establishments. If you are a do-it-yourselfer it can be as cheap as $10 if you buy all the parts from your local parts store. Dirty old oil can easily turn into sludge, hindering moving parts from moving freely, causing performance loss, poor fuel economy and increased wear. Difficulty: 1 or 3 for the do-it-yourselfer.3 Another cheap upgrade is your spark plugs. Not necessarily with high performance exotic alloy units, but just new factory replacements. An average conventional spark plug has a lifespan of about 30,000 miles. Anything past 30,000 miles, and the spark plugs electrode has probably worn off. Spark plugs should be checked every 10,000 miles for wear on the electrode and if needed, replaced with new ones. Difficulty:: 2 to 4 depending on vehicle.4 Air filters are used on all vehicles for obvious reasons of course. However, over time and depending on driving conditions, the filter can easily be clogged with dirt and debris. If the engine utilizes a panel filter, it can easily be tapped gently on the floor to remove the large debris. Pressurized air can remove the smaller debris (office duster works great). Make sure you blow the opposite direction of the air flow intake tract to prevent particles from being further embedded into the filter. Cone filters can also benefit from spring-cleaning and there are cleaning kits available to clean the filter. Air filters should be inspected every 10,000 miles and cleaned or replaced when necessary. Difficulty: 3 to 4.5 Depending on what type of ignition system your engine utilizes, some incorporate an ignition cap and rotor for transferring amplified ignition charge to the plug wires. After several hundred thousands transfers of ignition charge, the cap and rotor can wear, which can lead to misfires. The cap and rotor should be checked every 20,000 miles and replaced when the wear is too excessive. Difficulty: 4 to 5.6 Although plug wires rarely go bad, an intermittent ignition misfire can keep you scratching your head for weeks. <SEP> how to do a tune-up on an engine? <EOS>

the windshield in a car is actually two pieces of glass with a layer of polimer in the middle to keep the shield from breaking in large pieces in case of impact. This makes it harder to control the temperature of the glass on the outside as well as the inside. Fog ,during rain,on the inside only indicates the shield is a different temperature on the outside. The automotive industry uses defrosters to control the temperature of the glass thus giving a clearer view threw the glass. My advice would be to find out why the defroster wasnt giving me the proper results. If you choose to use a chemical, then rain-x  is about the best and can be used both on the inside of the shield and the outside.

Loosen the lugs first. Jack up the car and place it on jackstands for safety.  Remove the lugnuts and the wheel.  Unbolt the caliper and brake hose retaining bolts.  Remove the caliper, do not allow it to hang from the brake hose (I use a bungee cord and hang it from the spring).  Remove the brake pads if they didn't come out with the caliper.  The brake rotor will now come off easily, if not lightly tap it with a rubber mallet.  Reassemble in reverse order, being sure to clinch the tabs on the brake pads if so equipped, and be sure the anti-rattle clips are in place on the back of the pads.  I use an anti-squeal product on the back of the new pads.  Be sure to torque the caliper bolts to the proper specification.  Once the wheel is on the ground, re-torque the lugnuts to the proper spec as well.  Take the rotor to an auto parts store for thickness measurement, if too thin replace with a new one as a thin one will break.  If thickness is ok, have the old rotor turned (surfaced) if severely scratched or gouged.  I change my pads about every 30K miles before the rotors get damaged.

2, 4, 8, 16 .....Alternator Secrets Created 01/15/00 Anozira Updated 02/04/02 http://members.1stconnect.com/anozira ALTERNATOR SECRETSAUTHOR UNKNOWN - DATE UNKNOWN INTRODUCTIONIn the last two decades alternators have replaced generators in motor vehicles. The reasons are many: output current can be produced at lower rpm, voltage can be more accurately' controlled with solid state regulators, alternators need less maintenance, and they cost less to manufacture.When modified, auto alternators can provide variable direct current at 0 to 120 volts for battery charging, hot charging, light arc welding, or for running AC-DC appliances and lights. Another simple modification provides AC power to run some transformer-operated appliances. If you know the secrets of its operation and the modifications possible, the small low-cost alternator can become a versatile power plant.BASIC CONSTRUCTIONThe old-fashioned generator contains a wound stater which produces a constant magnetic field in which a revolving coil of wire, called an armature, turns. A commutator on one end of the armature made up of many individual brass segments passes the generated current to the outside world through carbon brushes.Because commutator segments must be electrically insulated from one another, they can not be fabricated from a single -block of metal. Each commutator segment must be individually attached to the armature shaft. This is a source of mechanical weakness. When the armature is rotated at high RPM, centrifugal force can cause the commutator to explode, throwing segments in all directions.To prevent explosions, the generator is usually driven at less than engine speed. An auto engine may turn 5000 RPM, but the generator must be geared to a maximum 2500 rpm for safety's sake. As a result, the generator turns so slowly at low engine rpm that it produces little or no current. A modern alternator, like the generator, contains both moving and stationary coils of wire. In the alternator, however, the moving coil, called the rotor, uses current supplied through slip rings to generate a moving field. Power is extracted from the stationary field coils.Slip rings replace the weak generator commutator. The rotor coils themselves are encased in a strong soft iron shell making the whole assembly much stronger than the generator armature. The net result is that alternators can be driven to much higher speeds without danger of explosion. In fact, alternators are usually driven at up to twice engine speed some running at 8000 rpm or more. At low engine rpm the geared up alternator turns much faster than a comparable geared down generator. The net result is that the alternator can begin producing useful charging current at lower engine rpm than can the generator. A coil of wire rotating in a magnetic field produces an alternating current with a frequency dependent on how fast the coil turns, one cycle being produced per revolution. A generator armature uses a commutator to mechanically switch rotating windings in and out of automobile's electrical system to produce direct current.The three separate stationary windings of the typical auto alternator produce three-phase alternating current. Rather than use a commutator to mechanically convert AC to DC, the alternator uses six diodes in a full-wave bridge rectifier circuit. In essence the diodes are solid state switches with no moving parts, making them maintenance-free and explosion proof.The alternator output voltage can be controlled or regulated by varying the rotor current. Regulators sample the output voltage and automatically change the intensity of the rotating magnetic field by adjusting the current fed to the rotor through the slip rings. The adjustments are made in such a way so as to bring the output voltage to the desired level.THREE-PHASE POWERSurprisingly, alternators are constructed with three sets of field wi <SEP> how do you tell how many poles a altenator has? <EOS>
Well there are several dirrefent kinds of stoppers for tubs on the market today.The on most people have in there homes are 1's with a trip lever on the overflow plate.To fix this probelm follow below.1'st unscrew the 2 flat headed screws on the plate. Set them on the floor not in the tub they could roll down to the drain this is for safety only.2nd pull unit straight up then towards you some will come out easy some you will have to move back and forth as you pull up.3rd on the back of the overflow plat the rob with the round stopper connects to the back of the plate with a clip.remove clip you will have to bend it straight and pull out.Go to the local hardware store and buy a new Overflow plate.and reinstall pin and bend it so it wont come lose then slide unit back into overflow pipe and screw back in.The problem you are haveing is on the overflow plat on the back side is a spring when you push the lever up or down the spring holds the stopper up or down. When the spring loses it strength it will not hold itself. NOTE= When you buy the new unit if it does not hold water 100% remove uniut and adjust the nut on the rod this will either raise or lower the stopper to the correct height.This info is if you have this unit installed on your tub.If this is not the unit you have on your tub and are still haveing this problem please feel free to contact me for the info on how to fix it.E-Mail me at   kos101@yahoo.comWhen sending your e-mail please describe what kind of unit you have.GoodLuck. <SEP> how do i fix a bath tub drain that will not stay open? <EOS>

I'm assuming you mean a standard dial type fan limit control. With the power in the off position, and holding the dial stationary, move the lower dial indicator to about 100 degrees and the higher number to about 150 degrees. The higher number is the temperature the fan will turn on and the lower number is the temp it turns off. Of course these settings can be changed for personal comfort, but these are a good start point.

You do not need to remove the center nut or the bracket. Your problem is the rotors are caught up on the parking brake which look similar to drum shoes only smaller.

Not used to removing "cottage cheese" but I often remove "popcorn, knock down, orange peel" from ceilingsFollow Instructions well (messy job)1. Remove all the furniture, artwork etc from the room2. Use roll plastic and masking tape to provide cover for  the floor, taping it securely to the baseboard around the room3. Get a broom handle and remove the broom head. Tape a drywall spatula to the end of the handle. Use several layers of tape to secure the spatula to the broom handle4. Bring a garden hose through the nearest window or door.Make sure the garden hose has a spray gun attached and place it on the fine setting (water should stream out not gush)5. Start in the far edge of the room and spray the ceiling till it turns color from white to a soft gray (May take some experimenting to see the amount of water you need to use) Test area should be approx. 6ft x 6ft. Wait approx 10-15 mins to let the water soak into the ceiling.6. Check the test area by holding up the broom and scraping with the spatula at a 45 degree angle (MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT DIG INTO CEILING ABOVE TEXTURE). Use a ladder if ceiling is beyond 8ftIf the test area was OK, the texture will fall off when you scrape it, if it is still too dry add more water and try again. Once you understand the technigue, spray the rest of the ceiling, wait 10-15 minutes and then scrape off the texture.After you are done scraping, please note that you may have to use joint compund to fill small holes or cover any exposed drywall tape (paper tape). Allow it to dry overnight and sand out the repaired areasp.s. When your finished, remove all the tools from the area and rollup the texture in the plastic and discardRooster Print ?Your really gonna paint Rooster(s) on your ceiling?Well here are general painting tips:1. Make sure there is plastic covering floor2. Use a good primer - I use KILLZ 2 which you can buy at Home Depot3. Use a brush to cut the edge of the ceiling with primer(NOTE: Apply masking/painter's tape to wall where it meets ceiling for best results) Make sure the entire edge has been painted around the room at least 2 inches wide4. Use a paint roller with an extension to fill in the entire body of the ceiling. Let dry at least 2 hours5. Check visually to see if the primer has covered the ceiling especially taking note of any stained areas. Repeat using roller until ceiling is uniform in color.6. Now that the canvas has been made, use the same paint techiques for a color paint (base coat) to go over the primer.I assume the rooster print is a stencil template which can be taped to ceiling after the primer and base coat are applied. Work slowly, making sure the template is firmly flat on the ceiling and choose brush and paint in relation to the size and color you needHope this helps ...

You basically remove the scratches  by buffing or polishing them out. polishing tools are available at any large automotive store. Make sure you use paper and masking tape to protect the trim and paint area around the windshield and to make clean-up lots easier.If you cant find it or dont want to risk something like that, you can send your car to a car wash or for servicing. The mechanics there will have the tools required.Bad news:  If your scratches are deep you will not be able to polish them out and a new windshield is your only solution. "Deep" means if your fingernail "catches" when you run it sideways over the scratch--it is probably gonna be too deep to polish out. As a last resort you could consult with a automotive glass speciality shop in your area for their opinion..it should be free, but don't be suprised if they want to sell you a windshield.Good luck.Arvind <SEP> how do you get scratches out of car glass windows? the scratches arent very deep but very noticable. please help! <EOS>

There are two ways: at the city water meter, you need a "meter key" wrench. There are a couple of types - if the valve has a tab on top, you need the key that looks like a fork at the end, and if it's a square nut, you need the one that looks like a lug wrench on the end. Either of those cost six or seven dollars at the hardware store. The easier way is to locate the place inside the house (probably the basement or crawl space where the water pipe comes in. There's usually a valve there you can just turn off with your hand. A final thought is that the water lines leading to the bath tub probably have valves along the way somewhere.

I too like to have due dates acknowledged and see in my lists which tasks have been completed and which are still left to do.  I quickly worked out that this was not going to be possible in Trello.

Installing 3-way SwitchesFrom Apply Now,Your Guide to Home Repair.You can turn the lights on here and off over there, and you can do it yourself once you know the trick. It's not exactly simple, but it's far less complicated than most people assume. There are two important things to remember to make 3-way switches work right. One is that the switches are really single-pole, double-throw devices. That means that one of the three terminals on each switch is always connected to one of the other two. The terminal that is always connected is called the point terminal. It should be specially identified. Most commonly, the screw for the point terminal will be dark and the other two screws will be bright. Toggling - flipping - a 3-way switch changes which of the other two terminals the point terminal is connected to. To help visualize this, you can think of a 3-way switch as a "V." The bottom of the V is the point terminal and the top of the letter is where the other two terminals are. Each time the switch is flipped, the wire terminated on the point is disconnected from one of the other two terminal screws and connected to the other. The other important thing to remember is that 3-way switches come in pairs. It takes two of them, and only two, to make the system work. In addition, three-way switching works because the two non-point terminals on one of the 3-way switches are always connected directly to the two non-point terminals on the other 3-way switch with a pair of wires called the travelers. A three-conductor cable - with or without a ground wire - connects the two switches and carries the two travelers. The third insulated conductor in the three-conductor cable is used as a hot wire or as a neutral, depending on which is needed. In every 3-way switch system, the ungrounded conductor from the panel - the "hot" wire - is connected to the point terminal on one of the two switches. The switch-controlled "hot" wire, which connects the switch system to the first controlled light, is connected to the point terminal on the other switch. The grounded conductor - the neutral wire - is not switched. It is carried to the first light and connected there. There are three scenarios that cover more than 90% of all three-way switch installations. One of these should work for you in a new installation. If you're troubleshooting existing wiring, one of these will most likely be what you are looking at. Remember to turn the power OFF at the panel before starting. For a new installation, remember to use #12 AWG (American Wire Gauge) wire on a 20 amp circuit. You can use #14 AWG wire on a circuit protected at 15 amps. <SEP> How do I hook up a three way switch?

Assuming you are following the welder's instructions, you only need a 3 wire plug (2 hot plus ground) and that is what you have.  The 50A 250V plug you have is a 6-50P in the chart at http://www.leviton.com/sections/techsupp/nema.htm right?

A blue wire is tied off (per the welders instructions).  That leaves a brown L1 wire and a black L2 wire, they are both hot.My question is...which of the remaining two straight prongs on the plug are hot?  Is it the tall blade (1/2"), short blade (5/16"), or both?  Which blades should the brown and black wire go to?  The welders instructions show nothing connected to a neutral wire.  The plugs instructions just show the green wire going to the ground, and 2 other wires going to the other two blades. <EOS>

I'm not sure what brand of edger you have, but I experienced a similar issue with an old walk behind craftsman edger I had. It was a three wheel with a three tip blade. What I did was to put a piece of wood (2x4 or something similar) underneather the blade. This allows the blade to 'grip' something without damaging the blade itself. (I also use this method for our commercial mower blades)Once the wood is under the blade, I put my knee (or any applicable pressure onto the top cover that went over the blade. This forced the blade to sit still while I applied the pressure to the nut.If you want to provide a model number of the edger, I can look at a picture and see if I have a solution more specific to your edger. <SEP> How do you change out a walk behind edger blade?

Don't call me gave one of the best answers..... I work on these all the time... wash it out with dawn dishliquid and warm water. Wrench it out good and let dry for a day or two, then oil it, make sure it gets throughout the filter, then squeeze it out good, reinstall it... start the engine, ( it will smoke some, depending on how well you got the oil out)... if your in a hurry, pour gas through it, wrench it out, reoil like above and install....

You don't.There are two options. 1/ replace the entire line ( requires a lot of digging)2/ Have a pool pro pressure test the line. He can do a leak location during the test and tell you within 6 inches or so where the leak is located. Even under 6 inches of concrete and 3 feet down. (less digging and cheaper than replacing the entire line) Then it's just a matter of digging out an area one man can work in, down to the break and inserting a coupling in the line. Typically, the hole in the deck can be just 2 feet by 2 feet in most cases and easily patched when the repair is done. The colour won't match if this is a concrete deck , I'm afraid, but there's no getting around that. Typically, the pressure test and leak location costs anywhere between 50 - 100 dollars depending on how long it takes them due to the nature of the pool and it's equipment. The actual repair, you could do yourself, but it's back breaking, requires working in a tight space, be good with basic hand tools and have a spotter ready to pull you out if you initiate a cave in with your head down that hole. If you get someone in to do the repair, the rate usually starts at about 200 dollars (unless it's a line just under dirt) and can easily top 600 if it's in a bad spot. If there's no way you want to cut the deck (like a stamped coloured concrete deck) then tunneling, when the leak is located is an option, but VERY expensive. I've dug a 12 foot one once under a garden that couldn't be disturbed to the leak and the bill came to over 1200 dollars. <SEP> how to fix a leak in a 2" Pvc pipe arround a swiming pool without a trench?

4.0 liter probably doesnt have a belt tensioner.  Most 4 liter dodge engines you have to loosen the idler pully and then the screw on top of the idler pully screws the idler down when you loosen it.  I could be wrong but I know that most 4 liters i have done are this way no tensioner just an idler pully that slides down when you loosen it. If it does have a tensioner then you should be able to use a 1/4 in ratchet.  Insert into the hole on the end of the tensioner and pull back.  I wrote to someone before about how to change a belt on a jeep.  This is what I said.  not that easy there is no tensioner on a 4.0 liter. First you need a 15mm socket. There is a idler pully on the drivers side of engine in front of teh power steering pump. Loosen the bolt in the center of the pully. Do not take all the way out just loosen a few turns. Then once you have the idler loose you need a 13mm socket and extension. Look down on the back side of the idler kind of on top. THere is a bolt that is about 4 inches long that goes down through the back of the pully. Loosen that bolt and the idler pully will slide down taking tensioin off the belt. Do this until you fel the belt is loose enough to remove. Once you have the belt off put new belt back on follow the diagram on the sticker under the hood. Follow the steps in reverse order to tighten. First tighten the bolt until the belt can be twisted about 1/4 to 1/2 side to side. once the belt is tight enough go ahead and tighten the nut on the idler pully and your done. Before you start it is helpfull to look at the bolt on the back and look where the threads are this helps you to get correct tension. also make sure you have the sticker for the diagram under the hood before you start. If you sont make sure you draw the belt or get one. It can be a pain to put back if you have no diagram. Well sorry so long but wanted to be specific.

you can try to drop the tank and empty it, but thats going to be a huge hastle, the easiest way to do it is to remove the bed. Don't be scared its not as big a job as most people think. There are 6 bolts on the bed remove them by using a T55or a T50 torqes bit or star bit, then unplug 2 wire harness from under the bed found near the spair tire, then remove 3 screws that hold th filler neck in place (where you put the gas nozzle when u pump) Then gab a 6 pack and call a friend(to help remove the bed. You can take it off your self but its easier with a second peson0. Remove the filler neck hose and siphon away. It looks like alot but trust me its not, and youll save yourself alot of time and money. It takes a total of 1 hour at the most.

First try the reset button, under the sink, usually a small red, round button on the side of the disposal.if it sounds 'stuck', that is, you can hear the motor try to turn, but wont spin, try to following.Take a broom stick, and stick the wooden end in the disposal (with switch off) and pry agaist the cutter to free it up.

Wash the car with dish soap like Dawn - that will strip the existing wax off the car while you clean it. (Do not use dish soap normally, as it strips the wax off a car - use real car wash soap)Next, clay bar the car to strip the containments on the paint down, smooth it out, and remove impurities, then use a paint cleaner if you want, or go right to polishing.  Immediately after you polish, wax the car.Wax goes on last - its the hard shell that protects the paint.Polish and clay bar will remove scratches and stains, but leaves the paint bare and it needs to be protected. <SEP> how to wax,polish and clay car? what to do first?

you can use a lot of products out there to remove paint. some of it is designed to remove it and yet others can damage it if used wrong.  Yes you could buff it out but try using a little laquer thinner on a rag. Don't rub real hard or you can damage the paint under it. Since the paint from the other car is on top of the wax and clearcoat it isn't really stuck on as hard as the paint on your car. I have also used easy off oven cleaner to remove paint off of vehicles that have been bumped or had lettering put on the sides for commercial vehicles. Just spray it on and let it sit for a few minutes then wipe clean. make sure it is not cold when you do this as the warmer it is the faster and better it will work. Also no matter what you use insure that you give the area a good waxing before you let the car sit out in the weather as any cleaner that you use will remove or damage the wax coating as well. If you have scratches in your paint after you remove the unwanted persons paint then you can get touch up paint at your local body shop or parts store. Touch up the paint prior to waxing or it won't stick. I have over 5 years body shop experiance and have had to remove tons of paint off cars including graffitti spray painted onto vehicles. Believe me "Easy Off oven cleaner" does work for the more tougher jobs.  For minor jobs try graffiti remover or goof off. In some cases just "WD40" will work.  Good luck. <SEP> How do you remove someone elses paint from your car? My friend has white 2006 mustang gt. It is in excellent condition.

The drain it's self unscrews out of the bottom of the tub, and a new one re threaded back into it's place. If it is the overflow, there are 2 screws that hold it into place, they can be removed allowing you to pull the water stop assembly up and out of the hole, you do the opposite to replace it with a new one. PS when you replace the drain in the bottom of the tub there are 2 things you will need. 1. the drain removal tool, and 2. some plumbers putty, both of which can be found at your local hardware store. Take an amount of plumbers putty in your hand and roll it into a log.

Once you add the destinations hit anywhere or hit find route  or list all steps for interactive map..

Possible solution...?

I about gave up and then decided to clear cache and restart the Chrome... presto!

Easy. Change pads? Disc or rotor. First remove the tire/rim. Sometimes they are stuck on so have a deadblow hammer handy.On rotor brakes the calipers must be removed from the rotors. The pads should pop right out. You may need a C-clamp to push the caliper piston in, so have one of those handy too. Replace the pads just as you found the others.For drum brakes, the drum head must be removed. I have found drum brakes easier to change once you have access to the pads.The only other thing to be done besides changing lines if you have a leak, is to bleed the brakes. You need two people for this.One person behind the wheel, and the person at the wheel well releases the nipple on the caliper. Person at wheel pushes brake to floor. You do this several times until you have good brake pressure. Don't forget to retighten the bleeder nipple you loosened. This gets rid of water and air in the lines.Make sure you have plenty of brake fluid in the resevoir.Not too sure what you meant by repair them.....if this doesn't cover it maybe you can be more specific. If you feel this is over your head, just take it to a mechanic. Changing the brake pads or getting brake service done isn't too expensive. <SEP> How do i repair my car brakes? <EOS>

And after draining the radiator, I recommend filling it with distilled water and running the engine awhile until the temperature comes up and the thermostat is fully open. Then the coolant that was in the engine will be diluted by the water you added. Then drain it again to get a better flush. You could also add a light duty cleaner after the first drain. When your all done flushing it in this manner, empty the radiator one last time and fill with 100% antifreeze. If you've drained the radiator enough times to have essentially only water in the engine, you'll end up with the desired 50/50 water/antifreeze concentration. <SEP> how to drain coolant on a 98 intrigue? <EOS>

disc brakes are pretty simple.. you need to remove the caliper (probably two or three long bolts), unbolt the disk, remove the cotter pin, replace the disc, put a new pin in, bend it off, bolt it up. If you need to change the pads, they usually clip out. (metal clips.. like snaps). You'll need a c-clamp to collapse the caliper to make room for the thicker new pads.  After you bolt the caliper back in place, you have to pump the brake a few times before the system is good to use.   Good luck.

If your car failed the ASM California test with elevated HC, it is best to perform proper diagnostics to identify the cause, then repair the cause.Assuming that your car in fuel injected, here is a list of POSSIBLE failures -- 1)  Vacuum leaks2)  Excessive advanced ignition timing3)  A MAP or MAF sensor slightly out of spec. voltage4)  Excessive engine coolant temp5)  EGR valve pintle stuck open6)  Restricted fuel filter7)  Failing fuel pump8)  Failing fuel pressure regulator9)  Sleepy, lazy or otherwise failing oxygen sensor.10) Contaminated engine oil11) PCV valve in need of service.12) Failed or deteriorating catalytic converterThere are many other items, but they are generally related to the above list.It is money saved to take the car to a LICENSED emissions repair and test facility, and ask that they run a diagnostic routine for the elevated hydrocarbons. Take the failure report so that he can look to see what he is chasing.Most shops will perform this task for about an hour's worth of shop time. The repairs will be on top of the diagnostics.One of the things that the tech can do with the report is to calculate the "LAMBDA" factor. This will tell him if the engine is in good fuel control or not, and if the primary cause is in the fuel control or if it is in the catalytic converter.If you believe you are being taken advantage of, call the Bureau of Automotive Repair at (800) 952-5210 and ask that they investigate. This is your tax dollars at work. Use them.In the mean time, if you are trying to get the license renewed, pay the fees. It is the State of California, they will take the money! That will stop the penalties at DMV. You won't get a sticker, but you will be paid up. Ask for an extension for driving. This will get you about 90 days more to make the repairs and pass the emissions test, or make the decision to trade the car in for something else.Good Luck <SEP> how can I reduce hydrocarbons (high and low speed) for a california smog test? <EOS>

Well do NOT USE DRAINO Or L-Plumber These products will eat the pipes. BAD IDEAUse a plunger alot with very hot water. If this does not work then remove the trap under the sink and clean it out. Make sure it is a 1 1/2 trap and not a 1 1/4 trap if it is a 1 1/4 put in a 1 1/2 trap.Also if the kids are causein this with TP then change brands and tell the kids not to use so much and also put the stopper back in the sink this will stop big chunks from going down the drain.I would say if the problem is beyond the trap and in the wall then snake it out and use (roto-rooter drain cleaner) Call your local dealer for this. The product does work good but if the kids are useing that much TP there is not much your gonna be able to do.The only thing you could do is talk to them and make sure the stopper is in and there is 1 other thing.You could remove the pop-up-assm and put in 1 that has no stopper but it has a screen (like what you would see in a tub a bunch of small holes.

For a good starting point try:-Lead came and copper foil glassworkFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation, searchThis article is on the techniques of lead-came and copper-foil glasswork. For a general overview of stained glass art, see stained glass. A typical copper-foil Tiffany lamp, with a dragonfly designLead-came and Copper-foil glasswork are the arts and crafts of cutting colored glass and joining the pieces into picturesque designs.The traditional method uses lead came. This is the method used for centuries in Europe, mainly in Religious buildings such as cathedrals, churches and monasteries, and also in aristocratic houses.An alternative method, replacing the lead came with copper foil, was invented in the 19th century, enabling creation of three-dimensional works, in addition to two dimensional ones to which the lead-came method is limited. The copper-foil artwork is commonly called Tiffany stained glass, even though there is a debate about whether John La Farge or Louis Comfort Tiffany invented this alternative to lead-came glasswork.Contents [hide]1 Overview 2 The process details 2.1 Designing on paper 2.2 Transferring the design to the glass 2.3 Cutting the glass 2.4 Grinding down the cut glass 3 Lead came 3.1 Stretching and cutting the lead-came strips 3.2 Assembling the lead and glass 3.3 Soldering the lead joints 3.4 Cementing the lead and glass panel 3.5 Adding reinforcement bars 4 Copper foiling 5 Tools and materials 5.1 General 5.2 For lead-came work 5.3 For copper-foil work 6 Other uses of the copper-foil technique 7 See also 8 External links  [edit]OverviewIn both lead-came and copper-foil glasswork a colorful design is created by the artist who joins pieces of stained glass panes that have been specially cut for the work.In the lead-came method the pieces of glass are embedded into the channels of the came, and then the joints between the came strips are soldered together.In the copper-foild method, the edges of the glass pieces are wrapped with copper adhesive tape, then soldered together along the whole length of the copper strip.[edit]The process details The steps in creation of Lead Came and Copper Foil Glasswork[edit]Designing on paperThe first step for both techniques is to create a design on paper. You can create your own designs, or use the large selection of design books and software available.The next step is to transfer the design to a piece of paper from which paper templates are cut out. Special pattern scissors are used, that cut out an extra thin strip of paper between the pieces, to compensate for the width of the lead-came or the copper-foil, that separates the pieces of glass in the final work. The scissors for lead-came work leave out a wider strip than for copper-foil.[edit]Transferring the design to the glassThere are two schools for this step: one practices gluing the cut paper to the glass before cutting it, the other holds the cut paper to the glass, and uses a paint pen to mark the glass around the paper edges. In a high output glass studio, professionals simply hold the pattern piece tight to the glass and carefully follow the edge of the paper with the cutter head. This can only be done well with practice.[edit]Cutting the glassIn this step the glass is scored using cutting oil and a steel or carbide wheel, making a tiny imperfection along which the glass is broken using glass plyers - when pressure is applied to the glass with the plyers, the glass snaps at the score line.[edit]Grinding down the cut glassThe glass pieces obtained from the previous step have sharp edges, and are not 100% accurate in their shape. The glazier can either account for this inaccuracy while glazing with lead came or implement an electric glass grinder with a diamond-coated grinding wheel to smooth-off the glass pieces, and to give them their accurate shape.

Depends on how the drawer is stuck... If it's stuck from age or swelling, etc. you can try removing the drawers directly below it and to the sides and see if it is open inside to where you can get to the drawer. If so, you might be able to see what's causing the jam or at least where it is. You can try using a small object as a prybar by wedging it behind the drawer and prying outward gently to free it. If there is something in the drawer that is getting caught against the front lip of the cabinet, try using your hand if there is enough clearance or the spatula if not, to pry downward on whatever is causing the jam and slide the drawer out.If you manage to get the drawer free and it is caused by sticking/swelling, rub some paraffin or candle wax along the area where the sticking occurs. It will help next time you face this problem. <SEP> How do I open a stuck drawer? The top middle drawer of my chest of drawers is stuck and I can't open it.

Do you have central air conditioning combined with your furnace?  If not, there may not be a condensate drain.   The condensation is a by-product of running the Air Conditioning.Often, the inside "coil" of the AC is located in the larged duct area between your furnace and the ducting that proceeds into your living areas.  So, a furnace in the basement, typically sees the AC coil above the furnace.  Look for tubes that travel from that unit to the box that sits outside.  One of the tubes goes down instead.  it could be a white colored PCV pipe, clear tubing, etc.   Drips of water will travel this tube to drain into a floor drain near the furnace or into a condensate pump (about the size of a shoe box).  This pump will push the water up another tube to the nearest drain -- perhaps a basement washtub sink.Good luck. <SEP> How do I find the condensate drain on my furnace?

Intake  0.008 in Exhaust  0.010 in  This is with the piston in the firing position, rockers off the cam lobe.It is highly unlikely that the lash adjustment has anything to do with the cylinder not firing (dead cylinder). It is possible that having no lash would cause it, but that is not apt to occurr on it's own. It is possible that you now have the valves set "too tight".I would suspect the real problem to be a burnt exhaust valve assuming of course there was spark at the wire, and the plug is good.

While I was getting the tools out, a friend bumped the ignition and changed location of the valves.  I adjusted it like whenIi checked the first time.  Car  would not start.  Adjusted back to where I tyhought they had been.  Got it to start again, but either dies or almost dies when you put it in gear.  What is the spacing on the rockers when the cylinder is open?  Any ideas why the cylinder could be dead?  New plugs, wires, cap and rotor.  Tried turning distributor also.  No difference.  But need to get it back to where it can be driven at least.  Any info on the valves would be appreciated.  Thanks. <EOS>

Remove the transmission pan, use an oil drain pan to catch all the fluid that will come out of the sides of it.allow fluid to drain out. The filter is easily viewed once you remove the pan. To remove the filter itself all you have to do is pull it off, theres no screws to it.  Make sure you also remove the grommet that is left in the hole where the filter came out of (it usually gets stuck in there). Replacing the filter all you have to do is push it in, usually it pops in there and when it doesnt fall out all by itself that means its on.Clean magnet on transmission pan. This is a good inspection point to see if you have any metal shavings. A little bit of shavings is normal, but when you start finding small chunks this is a sign of a serious problem.Remove all gasket material on trans pan and bottom of the transmission where the pan gasket goes. Make sure both of these surfaces are dry when replacing the gasket.Replace pan gasket and transmission pan. When tightening bolts make sure you do not OVER tighten. This could squeeze the gasket and cause a leak. Do NOT apply silicone to the gasket, they counter each other. By rule of thumb you can tighten the bolts using a wrachet holding your hand close to the head of the socket, when you can no longer turn the wratchet just using one hand then thats as tight as they need to be (75-80 lbs torque).Refill with fluid. Use any Dexron III fluid. it doesnt have to be from the dealer. Fill the transmission with 4 quarts and then start the vehicle, DO NOT DRIVE! Add the remaining amount while the car is running untill you reach the top mark (FULL or Warm) on the dipstick. This will usually take another 2-3 quarts, check the dipstick after you add each one.Your transmission on the caprice can hold 12-13 quarts total. When doing a transmission service it only lets out about 6-7 quarts.When topped off cycle the gears a coulple of times between reverse neutral and drive untill you feel it firmly gets into gear.  Now test drive the vehicle around the block (not far) bring it back and check the fluid level to make sure you are full, add fluid if needed. there your done.WARNING: if you are doing a fluid change because your transmission is having problems then there is a 50/50 chance your transmission will no longer work after you do the fluid change. In that case you needed an overhaul anyway. Sometimes the crap and material that is hanging around the fluid is the last leg of what is holding your transmission together and comes out with a fluid change. <SEP> how do you change the automatic transmission fluid,filter,and gasket on a 93 caprice 5.7liter? how many quarts <EOS>

Here are some tips...Try spraying a little WD-40 (TM ) oil directly into the door hinges, with the door still attached. Operate the door to check and see if that eliminated the squeak...If the door still squeaks, apply a little powdered lubricant (e.g., powdered graphite) inside the hinge (/ squeaky part)...If you don't have any powdered lubricant, you could try using some household materials that you may have handy. Try rubbing petroleum jelly or candle wax on the hinge...repeat these steps on the other hinge(s) if necessary.

First of all, an '88 Bronco is not worth anywhere near $3500.00. Try more like 1500-2000 IF it is REALLY nice. The rebuilt engine adds zero value. When the engine died, it was worth Zero. The fixed engine restored the value to the previous condition. A good rule is that if a vehicle is more than 80% depreciated, if the repair cost will exceed half the value of the vehicle, throw it away and get a different vehicle. For example, your Bronco sold for about 14,000 when new. It is now worth about $2,000.00 Therefore it is 85% depreciated. It is a close call, but I would be tempted to sell it for whatever I could get and take $4,000 and buy a newer vehicle. Fire your Mechanic. These Broncos are inexpensive to work on. Sounds to me like he is taking advantage of you. V8 engine repair bills are not higher than any other type of engine, and the 4wd has nothing to do with any repair that is not part of the 4wd system. If your mechanic thinks it is a great truck then sell it to him. And FIRE HIM IMMEDIATELY!!! A Good Mechanic will never tell someone whether or not a repair is worth doing. He will Educate and inform, but should NEVER make that judgement call. Interesting that the Judgement call he favors is YOU spend BIG MONEY with HIS REPAIR SHOP!!! Does he have a Kid in College? A new Corvette to pay for?   Good Luck! <SEP> How do you decide when to quit spending more money to keep your used car running? Currentley, I have spent 1,000.00 American to keep a 3,500.00 used car running. I could sell it for three thousand and five or spend another 800.00. If I spend the eight, the mechanic assures me it will be fine. Until the next time it developes another problem. I know this is difficult to answer without all the specs but I am just looking for a general answer. I would be grateful for any help I get. I have an '88 Bronco with a rebuilt engine. I can afford to but another used car for 5,000. but I wonder if it will be any better. Also, I don't know to much about cars, how to select a good used, that is. The mechanics assure me the bills are high because it is a V-8 with 4-wheel drive and worth the money. What with gas prices and all, I am beginning to wonder if I should just get something else. Please Help. I appreciate your answers. <EOS>
While watching the top left or right edge of the door,push the door up until it hits at the top.Notice if there is any gap between the top of the door and the channel (frame).If there is a gap,you will need a long screwdriver (flat blade screwdriver may work,may have to use #3 phillips)to back the screws out and lower the top rollers (in the top of door).Then if you still cannot lift the door up enough so the bottom of the door can clear the bottom track,you will have to back the bottom adjustment screws out so the bottom wheels retract up into the door.It can be a pain,good luck! <SEP> how do you remove a sliding glass door.? <EOS>
Well...  I hope you're talking about clutch (brake) fluid.  If so it will not be an internal transmission problem.  There is really only one of 3 things it can be: the master cylinder, slave cylinder, or the line itself.  Check the line for leaks and the slave as well.  If there is only fluid near the slave or no fluid at all it is probably the slave, but replacing a slave can sometimes cause the master to go out a short time later.  On a Honda, to just buy a master is probably expensive so I would just change the slave.  Just don't kill me if you replace your slave and find its the master.  You may need them both replaced, and if this is the case getting a new clean line is best also.To replace the slave, you should first loosen the line and let the fluid drain.  Try to pin the line up to prevent all the fluid from draining, but if not we'll bleed it anyway.  Now loosen the bolts holding the slave cylinder to the transmission and remove.  The push rod on the slave my be connected to the clutch fork somehow, you'll have to figure this part out (I'm not a Honda tech I work on diesels lol).  The inside of the boot may be holding all that fluid so be careful.  You should also notice the mounting of the slave.  Make sure the the bleeder screw is facing up.  THIS IS IMPORTANT AS IF IT DOES NOT FACE UP YOU WILL HAVE TO BLEED IT BEFORE INSTALLATION.  Now insall the slave onto the trans and loosen the bleeder.  Hook up the line (remember line wrench) and Fill master cylinder.  Use DOT 4 brake fluid.  You will see fluid start to flow out of the bleeder (hopefully) and when it is steady close the screw.  You may need to get help for this part.  Have a buddy pump the pedal.  Then tell him to hold it down (all the way) and open and close the bleeder.  Keep the fluid level up and when no more air squirts out it should be bleed.  Bleeding a clutch can be hard, it may take a very long time.  There are also other methods you can use.  If you're unsure I wouldn't do it yourself as you may wind up needing a tow truck.  Hope this helps. <SEP> How do u change the slave cylinder on a 96 Honda Passport? I guess that is what is wrong.

Several years ago I saw a PBS series on oriental rugs and that guy had a show dedicated to cleaning. he used a mild dish soap, a soft scrub brush, buckets and a garden hose. He had a big concrete pad to use. I would avoid the driveway at least any area where there might be any grease. Clean it before you use it. He inspected the rug for damage and moth holes and larvae. He picked off any he could find.. both on the under side and top. He wetted it down and scrubbed gently any areas of lots of dirt.

Debra, the starter must be uninstalled manually.After the starter is in your hands set it down on a surface or table near the vehicles battery.You will need a pair of jumper cables which you will attach to the battery terminals.You must then very carefully touch the cable terminal extensions from the battery to the 'bendix' of the starter (this is the mechanism that sends the gears into the starter motor and also contacts with the 'flywheel') and the other cable to the body or external armature of the starter.The bendix should kick in and the starter should whirl around.If the bendix does not engage the problem may be in the terminal relays. If the starter is engaged by the bendix but refuses to whir, then you may have a problem with the starter shaft bushings. If the bushings are worn out this will allow the body of the rotor to make contact with the starter casing which creates an electrical feed that makes the starter shaft rotate and thusly turn over the flywheel which in turn turns over the engine. Bushings are easy to replace and if you can learn how to do this you will save a bundle.As for the alternator problem you may have a good read out on your battery charging gauge if the alternator is working. Another way to find out whether the alternator is putting out energy is to turn your cars' engine on and then disconnecting one of the battery terminals. If the engine dies out you may have a bad alternator. Another method is by using an electronic meter to measure the alternators output. And by the way, alternators also fall victim to worn bushings that can be replaced by the owner of the car.

You need to buy new brake pads. <SEP> how do you repair a front brake pad on a 97 honda accord? <EOS>
When replacing brakes.  The front rotors (disks) are held in place by the calipers. There are 2 bolts that hold the calipers to the mounting plate. Typically allen head (hex)or torx (star) fasteners are used to secure the calipers.The mounting plate is held on by two bolts. (17-19 mm)1st jack the car up, place on stands, then chock the rear wheels. leave the steering wheel unlocked by placing the keyto the unlock position, but not in the on position.Turn the wheels so the inboard rear is accessible to the side you will start on. Remove the wheels. remove the caliper bolts, lift straight up on the caliper, and the brake pads can be slid out of the mounting plate. Remove the mounting plate, and the rotor will slide off.  if the rotor does not move. tap it gently with a rubber mallot.Remove the master cylinder cap (where the brake fluid is filled)) Get a "C" clamp that screws shut by turning it (any auto parts store will have one) Put an old brake pad against  the caliper piston (metal side against the piston)and compress the piston into the caliper until the metal part of the pad is flush with the caliper.The rotors can be taken to an auto parts store (I recommend Napa) They will measure the thickness of your rotors, and will tell you if they need to be replaced.  If not, they will resurface the rotors. When reinstalling.  first the rotor, then the mounting plate. Slide the brake pads on, along with any anti rattle clips or springs, that were on the car. Then the the compressed caliper. (if the calipers dont fit back on, you will need to compress a little more)  Same for both sides.Put the master cylinder cap back on, and pump the brake pedal until it becomes firm, and hard.  Check the brake fluid level, and ensure all fasteners are tight.Replace the wheels, tighten all lugnuts, put the car back on its wheels.  Test brakes in the driveway, and make certain they are stopping properly.  Good luck <SEP> How to change your car breaks,what if the disc is bad too? My car is Daewoo Leganza 2000. <EOS>

If your main breaker does not have lable on it, you can tell by the sizing of the wires coming in to it. If you can still read the writing on the cable, #2 Aluminum or #3 copper is good for 100 amps, 2/0 aluminum or #1 copper is rated at 150 amps, 4/0 aluminum or 3/0 copper is rated at 200 amps. If you have wires smaller than a # 3, you probably have an very old 60 amp service, which is pretty rare but I still run into them on occasion.

The refrigerator is split vertically down the center.  On the right side is one full-length refrigerator door.  On the left side are two half-size freezer doors (top & bottom) separated by a center ice/water dispenser.The unit is about 15 years old and a few months ago the full-length refrigerator door lost its suction, which now inhibits the door from staying securely shut.Any significant movement to the unit—like the opening and closing of the other two freezer doors—causes the refrigerator door to open about ½ inch.

Cleaning Bronze FAQBronze is copper alloy. In modern times, bronze is an alloy of copper and any metal except zinc. It is generally more expensive than brass and more corrosion resistant. Bronze forms a patina (green color) which is protective to the metal and is often seen on artwork. Reproduced it is called Verde. Bronze will deteriorate rapidly if exposed to moisture and chlorides or sulfides.Solid bronze often is lacquered (at the factory) to protect the finish. Lacquered bronze only needs dusting and an occasional wiping with a damp cloth. Have the lacquer replaced if it cracks or peels.Keep bronze pieces as clean as possible. Accumulations of dust and dirt can eat into the metal surface. Dust regularly using a soft cloth. Do not rub too vigorously, especially on any protruding parts. If a bronze piece has been neglected for a long time and is covered with grime, thoroughly clean it with a soft brush. Remove all dust from crevices and notches and then lightly rub the entire surface with a soft flannel cloth. For a more thorough cleaning, carefully wash with a solution of 1 tablespoon of salt and 3 1/2 quarts of water. Rinse well. Polish with copper polish followed by glass wax.  If you want a high polish, dip a cloth into liquid wax and apply to the piece. When dry, buff lightly to a high gloss. This wax treatment also may be given to bronze pieces that are kept outdoors. Weathered bronze usually darkens; however, this is natural and does not harm the piece."Bronze disease" is one of the most serious hazards of bronze. This disease, caused when chlorides and oxygen combine in a damp environment, also attacks brass and pewter. The disease takes the form of a sudden outbreak of small patches of corrosion and is distinguished by rough, light green spots. "Bronze disease" usually can be stopped by washing the piece in repeated changes of boiling hot, distilled water. You may have to soak the object for a week or more in distilled water. If this treatment does not work, consult a museum expert about using a strong solution of sodium sesqui-carbonate or have your piece treated by a professional.General Purpose Bronze Cleaner: Salt, Vinegar, and Flour. Dissolve 1 teaspoon salt in 1 cup white vinegar. Add enough flour to make a paste. Apply paste to bronze and let sit for 15 minutes to 1 hour. Rinse with clean, warm water, and polish dry. <SEP> how do you remove wax from bronze? my mom has a candle holder and the wax from the candle dripped and hardened on it.

Before any adjusting of the carb you must correct your timing by using a timing light. Crawl under the car with the car in park and the hot wire off the ignition, and have friend bump the ignition. With a flash light you should be able to see a groove on the harmonic balancer. Take a piece of soap stone or chalk and define this groove. With this done reconnect the hot wire to the distributor. Hook the timing light up to the battery and to the no. 1 plug wire. Now you are ready to check your timing. with the car running remove the vacuum advance line to the distributor and adjust the timing by turning the distributor to bring the timing mark to 8-14 degrees BTDC (Before Top Dead Center) this should get you in the ballpark for carb adjustment.There is not that much adjustments that can be made to a Q-Jet. The only one are the air and fuel mixture screws at the front of the carb. This takes allot of trial and error before you get good at this.
