Just because the car's lights work doesn't necessarily mean the battery is fine.Does the car turn over? A starter motor (electrical) actually turns your engine when you are trying to start your car. If when you put the key in and try to start the car and you hear no sound at all, or maybe a click and then no sound, it would either be your starter motor has died and it needs to be replaced, or your battery can't give enough amps to the starter motor to start up the car.I would recommend doing this in this order.1. Check the fluid level in the battery. If the fluid is low in the battery fill with distilled water up to the necessary levels.2. Have someone try to jump start your car with a pair of jumper cables. Let the good engine run for a minute to try to place a charge in your battery. If your car starts up, then the battery is what was dying, or you were low on electrolyte (what the water you added to the battery becomes). Drive the car for about 10 minutes to charge up the battery. Don't use any accessories if possible (ie turn off radio/head lights and anything electrical). If you turn off your car and it starts back up, your done.If trying to jump start the car and it doesn't turn over or all you hear is a ping or click sound, then your starter motor is most likely the problem. You'll have to get the starter motor replaced.<SEP>how do you troubleshoot a 1996 sable that will not start? Battery seems to be working, has lights, radio etc.<EOS>

hold on tight - I've been a builder for years and been on many ladders - the key is pay attention to everything you touch.   be sure the base of the ladder is on solid ground or at least seated in such a way that it cannot shift or kick out. When standing in front of the ladder your feet at the base - your arms out in front of you should just reach the ladder for proper angle too much either directin can be unsafe for kick out or falling over backward.  Other than that be sure you have an even surface for the top of the ladder to rest on and don't attempt any climbs at an angle left or right standing facing your ladder.

hi sato...test the mix of epoxy? that could be a little difficult.  most manufacturers will supply 2 component epoxies as a kit with the proper ratio of "a" (epoxy paint) to "b" (hardener or catalyst)...there are literally dozens of epoxy types on the market (polyamide cure, polyamine cure, acrylic epoxy, etc) and many of them are now available in both a solvent-borne and water-borne solution.  each of these different epoxies may require a different ratio of part a to part b...most of the solvent-borne polyamide cures (standard workhorse of epoxy coatings) are a 1:1 mix and an induction time of 30-60 minutes is often required before applying converted product - and pot life is usually 8-12 hours before converted product should be discarded.   contrast that to a water-borne acrylic epoxy that may have a 16:1 mix with no induction time and a pot life of 24 hours.each epoxy product has different characteristics and usually recommended for different types of application from swimming pools to industrial floors to surfaces exposed to solvent splash and extreme moisture...i think the key here is to find a contractor that has experience in the application of epoxy coatings and has the knowledge to direct  you to the proper coating for your needs (a contractor will save no money or labor by cheating on the mixture of epoxy but can create a mess if the product is not converted properly)...also, get to know your local independent paint store dealer - he/she can provide you with a ton of information (application, technical, surface preparation, disposal, etc.) on these high performance coatings...i hope this info is helpful to you...good luck on your projectsric<SEP>How do i test the mix of my epoxy coating?

Depends on how the drawer is stuck... If it's stuck from age or swelling, etc. you can try removing the drawers directly below it and to the sides and see if it is open inside to where you can get to the drawer. If so, you might be able to see what's causing the jam or at least where it is. You can try using a small object as a prybar by wedging it behind the drawer and prying outward gently to free it. If there is something in the drawer that is getting caught against the front lip of the cabinet, try using your hand if there is enough clearance or the spatula if not, to pry downward on whatever is causing the jam and slide the drawer out.If you manage to get the drawer free and it is caused by sticking/swelling, rub some paraffin or candle wax along the area where the sticking occurs.

And after draining the radiator, I recommend filling it with distilled water and running the engine awhile until the temperature comes up and the thermostat is fully open. Then the coolant that was in the engine will be diluted by the water you added. Then drain it again to get a better flush. You could also add a light duty cleaner after the first drain. When your all done flushing it in this manner, empty the radiator one last time and fill with 100% antifreeze. If you've drained the radiator enough times to have essentially only water in the engine, you'll end up with the desired 50/50 water/antifreeze concentration.<SEP>how to drain coolant on a 98 intrigue?<EOS>

The problem with any of the household soaps is they are made to attack grease, etc. and other substances and break it down. Which means any type of dish/laundry soap will attack the finish (shine) on your paint. Ever see a car with the clear coat gone bad? The owner probably used Joy dish soap time after time. I suppose a very light dose of a baby shampoo just enough to get suds wouldn`t do too much harm, but keep it light. On the interior rugs and uphol. again a very light watered down dish or laundry soap for dirt would be OK, use a brush and `rinse` with clear water. The dash and hard plastic parts (tires) maybe just a damp cloth to clean away dirt, and a very light coat of Pledge-type product? After applying wipe with dry clean cloth. It may however attract dust and remain greasy feeling, haven`t tried that one.

4.0 liter probably doesnt have a belt tensioner.  Most 4 liter dodge engines you have to loosen the idler pully and then the screw on top of the idler pully screws the idler down when you loosen it.  I could be wrong but I know that most 4 liters i have done are this way no tensioner just an idler pully that slides down when you loosen it. If it does have a tensioner then you should be able to use a 1/4 in ratchet.  Insert into the hole on the end of the tensioner and pull back.  I wrote to someone before about how to change a belt on a jeep.  This is what I said.  not that easy there is no tensioner on a 4.0 liter. First you need a 15mm socket. There is a idler pully on the drivers side of engine in front of teh power steering pump. Loosen the bolt in the center of the pully. Do not take all the way out just loosen a few turns. Then once you have the idler loose you need a 13mm socket and extension. Look down on the back side of the idler kind of on top. THere is a bolt that is about 4 inches long that goes down through the back of the pully. Loosen that bolt and the idler pully will slide down taking tensioin off the belt. Do this until you fel the belt is loose enough to remove. Once you have the belt off put new belt back on follow the diagram on the sticker under the hood. Follow the steps in reverse order to tighten. First tighten the bolt until the belt can be twisted about 1/4 to 1/2 side to side. once the belt is tight enough go ahead and tighten the nut on the idler pully and your done. Before you start it is helpfull to look at the bolt on the back and look where the threads are this helps you to get correct tension. also make sure you have the sticker for the diagram under the hood before you start. If you sont make sure you draw the belt or get one. It can be a pain to put back if you have no diagram. Well sorry so long but wanted to be specific.

you going to need a few tools. You going to need a compressor, drier, Condenser, Evapoerator core, and AC lines high and low side. Also you going to need a Vacuum pump to remove the air from the system because the mosture in the air will turn acidic under presure.  A pair of AC gauges, Compressor Oil, O ring seals, Refergertent R-134, and new belt. Thoughs should be the main pieces you will need.

If you need exact directions on how to replace the thermostat, then you better have it done by a professional Automotive Technician. And You say your car is overheating Huh? Does the heater get warm with engine temp? If not, then it's not your thermostat. Late Model BMW's have plastic waterpump impellers that break off, Yes the car overheats like a stuck closed thermostat, BUT the one thing you will notice is that the heater doesn't blow hot air, Cooling system is full, Car overheats, heater stays cold.

Had the same problem this spring. The bolts that you are probably referring to is in the powerhead unit. These are not your ordinary drill out type of bolts and then use an easy out like everyone here is recomending to you. Outboard motors are a unique repair due to the useage of them in SALT water with the corrosion in the head around the bolts. These cannot be removed by yourself. they must be taken to a machine shop to have them removed professionally. This is not an easy task or is it a cheap repair. These bolts alone are made for outbord motors and must be replaced with the same type of outboard replacement parts. The cost for labor and parts can run you several hunded dollars or maybe even over $1000. Best bet is to take it to a repair shop that does this every day, probably at a marina.  I dont know your model or size of this outboard but after you get this estimate , carefully decide weather the cost of the repair is worth the repair. Consider how many hours you have on this outboard. If your estimate runs into the thousand dollar or higher, and you have a lot of hours on the engine, then you may be more apt to buy a new outboard engine. I went this route about a month ago and decided that my $2200 estimate and 500 hours on my engine was not worth it. i bought a new outboard in another state and towed it home. I put my outboard for sale on E-Bay and sold it at a decent price to offset my new outboard price.Good Luck and think before you repair.<SEP>How do you remove broken bolts?

Since nobody wants to tell you what to do...I will. Get an oil drain pan. Get 4to 5 quarts of oil and the recommended oil filter. Put the drain pan under the car directly under the oil pan drain plug. Use a six point socket or wrench, And an oil filter wrench that fits your cars oil filter. The six point ones help keep you from stripping the bolt head. If it seems tight bump the wrench in the direction you need to go.with your hand. A bump breaks free bolts that you can't get loose a lot easier. Try not to drop the drain bolt in the drain pan unless you get one that has a catch screen designed to keep things from falling into the oil drain pan. Once the oil has drained. Reinstall the drain plug. Make sure if it has a gasket on it that the gasket is there when you reinstall it... It can be over looked if the gasket fell off the plug..Next. Remove oil filter using the oil filter wrench. Unscrew it and let it drain in the pan. Then physically look at the filter and make sure the rubber gasket is still on the old filter. It is possible for the filter to come off,and the o ring gasket to stay stuck on the engine... This is a big no no. Because if you screw the new filter on with the old gasket in place it's not gonna seal and make a huge mess when you start your car. Now that you know that you don't have the old gasket still on, take the new filter and put a light film of oil on the gasket of the new filter.... You can use new or old oil to put on the gasket..It doesn't matter. Screw new filter on as tight as you can by hand. Then take your filter wrench" and I only say this because your a femal and may not have the hand strenth to get it tight enough with out the tool. And tighten it another1/4 to 1/2 turn. Then just fill it up with oil. Put in 3 quarts and check the dipstick. Then just keep adding oil till the dipstick finally is on the full mark. Then start your vehicle. look under it and see if you have any leaks.... Turn the car off and wait 1 to 2 mins and check the level again. Then just fill as needed till oil on the dipstick where it should be and your done. I was a little too detailed but that's because I'm guessing you've never changed oil in anything before by yourself<SEP>how do i change the oil on my fiesta 1.1 lx?<EOS>

I'm not sure exactly what you mean but if you're talking about the rain water coming off your house, one way is to bury black drain tile underground and extend it several feet away from the house.  You can also connect some of the drain tile with a wye connector.  Drain tile is the black drain hose that is sold at major home supply stores.  If your yard is sloped, you can bury the drain tile so it drains away from the house in the low lying areas.  This is especially effective if you have downspouts that drain across a sidewalk.  You can bury the drain tile under the side walk and connect it directly to the vertical downspout.  One of the most effective ways to dig under a sidewalk is to use a garden hose and water pressure. They sell fittings that connect gutter to drain tile.  Drain tile is also relatively inexpensive.<SEP>How can you move rainwater underground away from the house?<EOS>

Hi, you dont need it completely free of the old sealent. Just scrape off as much as you can and get it reasonable flat, doesn't have to be perfect. Do the same for the car side but don't be too ambitious or you'll scrape the paint.

We went through the moisture problem and crawlspace vent issue years ago.  We found that there were conflicting opinions about vents, moisture barriers, sump pumps and proper ventilation. We were enlightened when we researched more.We found each home can have its own solutions but the moisture levels in the wood tell you much.  When moisture levels are over 20%, decay is inevitable but not rotting yet.  Moisture levels over 28% means the wood decay fungi is active (it feeds on the starch of your wood to rot it) and there is likely visible damage already.  Fungi and mold do not grow or become active if the levels are lower.  Generally, air flow keeps moisture levels down.Here is a Clemson University PDF home maintenance publication about moisture levels and control at :http://virtual.clemson.edu/groups/psapublishing/PAGES/FYD/HL255.pdf  Also NC State has one at http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/fcs/housing/pubs/fcs486.htmlThis is good too.
